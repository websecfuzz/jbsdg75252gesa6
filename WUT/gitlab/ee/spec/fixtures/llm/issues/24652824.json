    "description": "### Description\n\nAs of now, repository charts report percentage of language in the repo.\nFirst, it is not obvious how this percentage is computed (number of files? number of lines? bytes? what about comments? libraries?). Second, I would love to see some *absolute* data (number of files, lines, bytes).\n\n### Proposal\n\nAs a user I would like to see the number of lines of code per language.\nIdeally, excluding blank lines and comments, but that is optional.\n\n### Documentation blurb\n\nAs for use cases:\n* better understand the repo structure\n* if this is your repo, being able to report the number of lines of your main language\n    * this is one of the metric employers would like to know (I personally was surprised by this question on interview and could not clearly respond)\n* all those use cases for general repo graphs (like pie chart of languages)\n\n### Details\n\n[A useful comment from ZJ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/17800#note_214979038):\n\n> Just so its stated explicitly, the language bar on the projects overview page is based on bytes. Iteration over each blob to count the number of lines will be quite expensive and to make it performant on gitlab.com scale will be quite the challenge :smile: Bytes are chosen as Git stores the size of each blob with its name. So if a blob has the path `path/to/file.rb` it can take the extension and detect it's Ruby. It already has the number of bytes, so it can move on.\n\n> Lines however is harder, as now you'd have to either iterate each blob each time, or be clever with caching combined with diffing, which in turn might lead to race conditions.\n\n> That all being said, this would require a new RPC to Gitaly, and gitaly-proto changes. Happy to review MRs there! :cat:\n\n### Potential Workarounds\n\n- Run `scc` in a GitLab CI pipeline: https://github.com/boyter/scc to generate SLOC/etc. reports\n- If API use is acceptable (instead of UI), parts of its output stats can be stored as custom attributes on the project: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/custom_attributes.html#set-custom-attribute",

      "note": "Just so its stated explicitly, the language bar on the projects overview page is based on bytes. Iteration over each blob to count the number of lines will be quite expensive and to make it performant on gitlab.com scale will be quite the challenge :smile: Bytes are chosen as Git stores the size of each blob with its name. So if a blob has the path `path/to/file.rb` it can take the extension and detect it's Ruby. It already has the number of bytes, so it can move on.\n\nLines however is harder, as now you'd have to either iterate each blob each time, or be clever with caching combined with diffing, which in turn might lead to race conditions.\n\nThat all being said, this would require a new RPC to Gitaly, and gitaly-proto changes.

But just looking at our entire codebase / repositories from the top and knowing there's \"90% of PHP\" in some project without understanding there's a million lines of it doesn't really help. So while individual teams may have a good grasp of their project, somebody looking over our entire portfolio you need more information to figure out who you should get in touch with. Obviously you can also try to check the file size metrics etc. and try to filter out uninteresting file types or other similar cumbersome workarounds but it's just more work to land on data that could easily be provided by the platform directly.",

In first place GitLab need to improve its role system, this is a real bummer:) But GitLab doesn't do it for 2 years, so probably they have more important tasks.

This will include licenses, headers, empty space and so on.\n\nThere are some additional thoughts in https://gist.github.com/mandiwise/dc53cb9da00856d7cdbb that have iterated on my approach from two years ago :sweat:",

I guess most people do not need per hour stats about n lines of code. For me even once per month would be enough. (And thus could be used for #12104 as well)",

That makes me hopeful we could match that frequency with line counts.  So let's tentatively say the MVC would be updated pushly (instead of monthly like I proposed above).",
