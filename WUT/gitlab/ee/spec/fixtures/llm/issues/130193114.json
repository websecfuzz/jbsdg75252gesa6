    "description": "## Basic setup\n\n1. [x] Read the [code review page in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/) and the [code review guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html).\n1. [x] Understand [how to become a maintainer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#how-to-become-a-project-maintainer) and add yourself as a [trainee maintainer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#trainee-maintainer) in the [team database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/team_database.md). (MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/105456+)\n\n## Working towards becoming a maintainer\n\nThese are only guidelines. Remember that there is no specific timeline on this.\n\nAs part of your journey towards becoming a maintainer, you may find it useful to:\n\n1. [ ] Act as a coach in a big deliverable that requires [following the planning step](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/development_process.html#planning-development) as part of the trainee program.\n1. [x] [Shadow a maintainer](#code-review-pairing) while they review an MR. This will allow you to get insight into the thought processes involved.\n1. [x] [Have a maintainer shadow *you*](#code-review-pairing) while you review an MR *as if you were a maintainer* . Ideally, this would be with a different maintainer to the above, so you can get different insights.\n1. [x] *Optional:* [Consider finding a mentor](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#trainee-maintainer-mentorship-pilot-program) to help you become a maintainer.\n\nIt is up to you to ensure that you are getting enough MRs to review, and of varied types. All engineers are reviewers, so you should already be receiving regular reviews from Reviewer Roulette. You could also seek out more reviews from your team, or #frontend Slack channels.\n\nYour reviews should aim to cover maintainer responsibilities as well as reviewer responsibilities. Your approval means you think it is ready to merge.\n\nAfter each MR is merged or closed, add a discussion to this issue using this template:\n\n```markdown\n### (Merge request title): (Merge request URL)\n\nDuring review:\n\n- (List anything of note, or a quick summary. \"I suggested/identified/noted...\")\n\nPost-review (opportunities to learn):\n\n- (List anything of note, or a quick summary. \"I missed...\" or \"Merged as-is\")\n\n(Maintainer who reviewed this merge request) Please add feedback, and compare\nthis review to the average maintainer review.\n```\n\nThe purpose of comparing your review to the maintainer's review is to engage in active learning and expand your list of items to consider. Remember, different maintainers are going to identify different issues in the same code. As long as you are not missing large errors or bugs, don't feel like you are doing a bad job if you and a maintainer make different suggestions.\n\n**Note:** Do not include reviews of security MRs because review feedback might reveal security issue details.\n\n**Tip:** There are [tools](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#trainee-maintainer-issue-upkeep) available to assist with this task.\n\n### Code Review Pairing\n\nMuch like pair programming, pairing on code review is a great way to knowledge share and collaborate on merge request. This is a great activity for trainee maintainers to participate with maintainers for learning their process of code review.\n\nA **private code review session** (unrecorded) involves one primary reviewer, and a shadow. If more than one shadow wishes to observe a private session, please consider obtaining consent from the merge request author.\n\nA **public code review session** involves a primary reviewer and one or more shadows in a recorded session that is released publicly, for example to GitLab Unfiltered.\n\n* If the merge request author is a GitLab team member, please consider obtaining consent from them.\n* If the merge request author is a community contributor, you **must** obtain consent from them.\n* Do **not** release reviews of security merge requests publicly.\n\n## When you're ready to make it official\n\nWhen reviews have accumulated, and recent reviews consistently fulfill maintainer responsibilities, any maintainer can take the next step. The trainee should also feel free to discuss their progress with their manager or any maintainer at any time.\n\n1. [ ] Create a merge request updating [your team member entry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/team_database.md) proposing yourself as a maintainer.\n1. [ ] Keep reviewing, start merging :metal:",

I would recommend to still address these but with a more open question:\n\n\"Could you help me understand why we would need this additional check on this value?\"\n\nThis will lead to the same result but reduce the risk to remove a needed check in a hurry.",

      "note": "Hey there @deepika.guliani! Most of my points here were about specs readability and predictability. There was nothing here that would have prevented a merge, but sometimes when asking small questions, we find some underlying problems and understand the why.\n\nFor example, [when I proposed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/131028#note_1555293432) to move the `toggle?.remove` call to the afterEach block, it was a nitpick and it did not block merge, but by pointing it out, the author and I had a chat and we found out that the wrapper was being mounted twice and that's why there were some issues! This did not impact the tests right now, but it might have in the future as more and more tests were added and then the bug becomes harder to find.\n\nThis is not to say that you missed anything really (your reviews are all great!). More that especially in specs, it's easy to miss a lot of underlying problems and it's worth spending a bit of extra time to make sure that everything behave as it should, not just that tests are passing.\n\nKeep up the awesome work!",
