    "description": "# Summary\n\nUntil all issuables records are migrated to work items, we will be in a state where we will have relationships (parent/child & linked) between issuables and work items.\n\nTo that end, we need a way to associate existing Issuables to a Work Item. This effort will act as a \"compatibility-layer\" to make Work Items and Issuables work together while the migration is fully completed.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. Parent epic (work item) with child issue (issuable)\n2. Epic (work item) blocked by Issue (issuable) - _new relationship use case being introduced in work items_\n3. ~~Epic (issuable) blocking Objective (work item)~~ - _based on the [high level estimate](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10851#note_1488766787) provided by engineering, we will not pursue this use case._",
