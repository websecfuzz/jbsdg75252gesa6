      "note": "@jackib @gweaver @mushakov Thanks for the feedback! Will try to address it point by point below.\n\n### General\n\n> * For Iteration 1B, do you mean all four areas should be applied to Tasks, Objectives and Key Results at the same time? Confirming this, as I think this epic is a blocker for migration of Epics and Issues.\n\n@jackib Are you asking about what I mean by `When updating the work item detail view, there are a number of changes that need to happen all at once to provide value and a consistent, usable experience for our users.`? I just mean that 1B.1 (Two-column layout), for example, shouldn't be released without the other items in 1B.\n\nWhen it comes to work item types, I believe that any change we make to the work item will automatically apply to all work item types (currently tasks, objectives, and key results).\n\n> * What do you think of adding an updated date column to your tables, that way we can keep this from getting stale?\n \n:thumbsup: Will do, but I think I'll add it to the top of the table instead of a separate column (which will make all the columns narrower).\n\n> * Since the detail page design directions are so different from the current Task view, can we add current screenshots to issues, in addition to the proposal? For the current, just a screenshot of the affected parted of the Tasks view would be fine.\n\n@jackib Do you mean add screenshots of the current state to this Epic? Or screenshots of the current state to each issue as they move to implementation?\n\n### Parent / ancestry widget\n\n> * For Iteration 1B, I wonder if the Parent/Ancestry and Create improvements have to be part of it, or can be a 1C, or as part of Iteration 2?\n\n> * For 1B.3 (`Parent / ancestry information`) - Do we need to make this a dependency of 1B given the parent information is already present in the secondary breadcrumbs above the title? Rationale: It already exists in the experience today for Tasks, Objectives, and Key Results. The impact/change is limited to only these three work item types. Moving it to a widget in the sidebar seems like more of a consistency thing rather than a usability problem we're solving.\n\nMy thinking here is that moving the parent / ancestry information into the sidebar is fairly big change from how the work item currently is and that it makes sense to introduce that change when we introduce the sidebar. But that's a pretty loosely held opinion, I'm happy to split that out into a separate iteration if that's what others feel strongly about. @nickbrandt would appreciate your input since you're working on that widget!\n\n### Create / edit experience\n\n> * For 1B.4 (`Create / edit experience`) - The create experience and related workflows feels like a separate problem and set of MVCs from the two-column layout. Maybe the creation should block releasing Objectives and Key Results instead of defaulting the two-column layout to \"on\"? Editing the detail view, specifically the Title and Description, via the new `Edit` button proposed for the breadcrumb row, feels more like a dependency for enabling the two-column layout given the outcome I think UX is looking for is fully removing the \"click to edit\" pattern from the work item detail.\n\n> I think of `Create / edit experience` as a separate iteration after we have arrived at the desired modal layout. Can you expand on why you recommend coupling this with the rest of the changes?\n\nI actually don't have a strong reason for create/edit being part of iteration 1B, I put it there because I thought it was one of the areas we'd discussed in our sync meeting (but I may have gotten my wires crossed there). I'm happy to move it to a later iteration independent of the two-column layout. \n\n@gweaver it sounds like you're suggesting the edit/create is a dependency for the two-column layout, am I reading that right?\n\n### Additional widgets (dev widget, child items, linked items, etc)\n\n> These aren't present on work items now, so we can treat each of them as separate dependencies for the top-level \"migrate \\[insert object\\] to work items\" epics. WDYT?\n\nMakes sense to me! :thumbsup:",

Confirming this, as I think this epic is a blocker for migration of Epics and Issues.\n* For Iteration 1B, I wonder if the Parent/Ancestry and Create improvements have to be part of it, or can be a 1C, or as part of Iteration 2?\n\n**Few suggestions on documentation**\n\n* What do you think of adding an updated date column to your tables, that way we can keep this from getting stale?\n* Since the detail page design directions are so different from the current Task view, can we add current screenshots to issues, in addition to the proposal? For the current, just a screenshot of the affected parted of the Tasks view would be fine.\n\ncc @amandarueda @mushakov",

      "note": "@esybrant I agree all of these things should be done prior to migrating epics and issues to the work item architecture. Here's my initial feedback and questions:\n\n- For 1B.3 (`Parent / ancestry information`) - Do we need to make this a dependency of 1B given the parent information is already present in the secondary breadcrumbs above the title? Rationale: It already exists in the experience today for Tasks, Objectives, and Key Results. The impact/change is limited to only these three work item types. Moving it to a widget in the sidebar seems like more of a consistency thing rather than a usability problem we're solving. \n- For 1B.4 (`Create / edit experience`) - The create experience and related workflows feels like a separate problem and set of MVCs from the two-column layout. Maybe the creation should block releasing Objectives and Key Results instead of defaulting the two-column layout to \"on\"? Editing the detail view, specifically the Title and Description, via the new `Edit` button proposed for the breadcrumb row, feels more like a dependency for enabling the two-column layout given the outcome I think UX is looking for is fully removing the \"click to edit\" pattern from the work item detail. \n\n> I originally had adding additional widgets (dev widget, child items, linked items, etc) as part of Iteration 2, but it seems like many of those things are already captured in the epics for migrating epics/issues to work items. How do we want to structure that?\n\nThese aren't present on work items now, so we can treat each of them as separate dependencies for the top-level \"migrate [insert object] to work items\" epics.

      "note": "> it sounds like you're suggesting the edit/create is a dependency for the two-column layout, am I reading that right?\n\n@esybrant I'm suggesting the edit and create workflows be split into different iterations. The update pattern needs to be consistent and clear (ex: we are proposing introducing a new `Edit` button in the breadcrumbs area), which is scoped to the detail view. The create workflows do include the detail view, but also encompass areas of the product outside of the detail view, so I think that workflow can be improved after we release improvements to the detail view.",
