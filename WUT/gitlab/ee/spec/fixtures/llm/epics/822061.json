    "description": "This epic tracks the work to bring the [GitLab Duo Chat](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ai_features.html#gitlab-duo-chat) system to Beta. This includes the backend where the heavy lifting is done and the WebUI frontend.\n\n**While this epic does NOT include the **[**Chat in VS Code and Web IDE**](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10522 \"Bringing GitLab Chat to WebIDE & VSCode via Gitlab Workflow Extension\")** work, it needs to build the backend in such a way that it can support clients other than the WebUI - specifically IDEs**. It must consider that the IDEs may not have the same context as the WebUI. For instance, an IDE may not know the URL of the code file the user is looking at, as the user might have just created it locally. Also the file may have changed on the client. The maturation of the Chat in VS Code and Web IDE is independent of the chat system maturation.\n\n:movie_camera: [Video Walk-through of this epic](https://youtu.be/T645Ppm8oQ0)\n\n## Overall Scope\n\n### Functional scope\n\n* [x] Chat can be opened anywhere on the GitLab Web page. (Excluding [Web IDE](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10522 \"Bringing GitLab Chat to WebIDE & VSCode via Gitlab Workflow Extension\"))\n* [ ] Chat answers questions relating to\n  * [x] code the user sees (explain \"this\")\n  * [x] code referenced (with URL)\n  * [x] issue the user sees\n  * [x] issue referenced\n  * [x] epic the user sees\n  * [x] epic referenced\n  * [ ] ~~MR the user sees~~ (removed from beta scope)\n  * [ ] ~~MR referenced~~ (removed from beta scope)\n  * [x] how to use GitLab\n  * [x] recent context from chat history (i.e. Conversational Chat enabled)\n  * [ ] ~~selections (if something is selected e.g. code in the code file, this is added to the context so the chat can answer questions about the selection)~~ (removed from beta scope)\n  * [ ] dummy tools exist that proof the agent can support many more use cases (pipeline context, global issues/epics/code contexts)\n* [ ] If context is not available, [chat responds with its supported contexts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415801 \"Self-discoverable capabilities of the chat via responses of the chat itself - e.g. I can't answer this questions but I can answer questions that are about the code you are looking at...\").\n* [x] User can give feedback on their satisfaction with the answers and these answers are analyzed to inform potential prompt engineering tweaks.\n\n### Non-functional scope\n\n* [x] **By design: The tools and the agent(s) must never share context that the user does not have access to.**\n* [ ] The quality bar for what success means ([see below](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10550#what-does-success-mean \"GitLab Duo Chat [Beta]\")) is defined, tested and passed\n* [ ] [Perceived speed of answers is at least o.k](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10683). from user perspective and there are ideas how to improve it to good.\n  * [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/419531+s\n  * [ ] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/419531+s\n* [ ] Errors are tracked.\n\nOne of these two options. Still TBD:\n\n* [ ] Works in the main product for Ultimate users that have toggled the right switches in the settings.\n* [ ] **Access to the Chat is granted if the user has paid the add-on.** The project or the tier of the project's namespace does not matter. [This still needs to be confirmed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/421295#note_1515265994 \"Discuss: Allow the user to use the chat while not being in a GitLab repo\").\n  * [ ] During the pre-GA phase or pre-addon phase, all SaaS users that are at least in one Ultimate tier, do have access to the chat. [This still needs to be confirmed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/421295#note_1515265994 \"Discuss: Allow the user to use the chat while not being in a GitLab repo\").\n\n## What does success mean?\n\nGenerally\n\n* AI answers should be _mostly_ correct, helpful and friendly.\n* If the AI does not know it should _mostly_ say that is does not know.\n\n#### How to measure it?\n\n~~We shall consider the experience Beta-ready once we have achieved the following:~~\n\nWe shall consider the experience satisfactory once we have achieved the following:\n\n* Users consider \\>80% of responses `good` or `excellent`\n* Users consider \\<5% of responses `terrible`\n\n(on a 5 point scale: `terrible`, `poor`, `average`, `good`, `excellent`)\n\nSee [details why we opted for this quality bar](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/3555#note_1541945461 \"KR2: GitLab Duo Chat becomes available in beta, including six “specialized tools” that are also in beta, with a path to general availability in FY24Q4.\").\n\n[This user satisfaction will be assessed by UXR roughly every two to three weeks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2513 \"Repeated analysis of user experience with Duo chat as we continuously improve the chat (also considering the outcome of each round of these user tests.)\"). Check the [bottom of our AI Features Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/1137231/Ai-Features) for these metrics and how they progress toward the goal.\n\n## Work items (remaining as of mid August)\n\n#### Understand in more detail the problem space and how well we address user needs (mostly UXR and Product analytics)\n\n**Outcomes**: More clear understanding of users expectations and which problems they want to solve interactively with the chat.\n\n* https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11120+\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics/-/issues/1325+\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2513+\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415591+\n\n#### Addressing functional gaps & UX issues\n\n**Outcomes**: better user experience measurable in better scores in user testing\n\n- ~~MR context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412430+s~~ (removed from beta scope; see [reason](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412430#note_1545114583))\n- Epic context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422091+s\n- Support selected text: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422176+s\n- Streaming: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10683+s\n- Dummy contexts: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422187+s\n- Self-discoverable capabilities: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415801+s\n- [Collection of UX issues to be addressed](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10673 \"Chat Integration iteration 1 FE & BE\"). Such as:\n  - new conversation\n  - sync chat across clients\n  - onboarding\n  - expiration time for response\n  - Error messages\n  - feedback mechanism\n  - ~~Global entry point for chat should be enabled for beta release but should not be enabled before we reach our quality target.~~ [Global entry point for chat will only be turned on when we reach the quality target defined above independent of the beta release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2465#note_1577201457). \n- **Continuously test user satisfaction with UXR and respond to their feedback**\n\n#### Developing a testing framework\n\n**Outcomes**: enabling efficient development and efficient contribution\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422212+s\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422245+s\n\n#### Monitoring quality / stability / speed / cost\n\n**Outcomes**: more trust production readiness of the chat\n\n- https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11234+\n  - Cost: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415944+s / https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics/-/issues/1358+s\n  - Error rate: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/421546+s tracks the error rate on individual 3rd party AI requests as well as error rate from the user perspective as responding to their request might require combining multiple 3rd party AI requests. @jprovaznik's assumes there are no errors beyond the 3rd party LLM service that would need to be considered (for instance between the backend and the client). The user level error rate calculation will interpret slow responses \\>20 sec to be errors. The error rates will be tracked in Grafana.\n  - Response time: <span dir=\"\">\\~\\~</span> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics/-/issues/1366+\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\~ Will be tracked in Prometheus on the worker level as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/421546+s by @jprovaznik. These measurements will include the time for all AI requests necessary to answer the user question but not the time to receive the user input from the frontend and sending the result back to the frontend. The difference should be marginal.\n  - \"Can't answer\" rate: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422202+s\n\n#### Other work items\n\n- [ ] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/420939+s (switch embeddings provider)\n- [ ] Mature the chat documentation and bring it to its own page.\n- [ ] Label the Chat as beta in the product and in the documentation. \n\n#### Integrate existing stand-alone AI features ???\n\n- Should we integrate existing standalone AI features like _explain this code_ into the chat prior to the Beta release?\n- We should only do so if they reach the quality bar defined above.\n- What interdependencies are there with company announcements?\n\n# What the user can ask\n\n### Questions related to current code\n\nQuestion | Tool test | Quality test \n---|---|---\nCan you explain the code?

I think the only solution for such questions is to have a means for the AI to ask a clarifying question, for example the following\n- Bot: `The term template is used widely in the context. Could you be more specific which kind of template you would like to create?`\n- Tool test:\n- Quality test: \n\n## What will not be supported\n\n* We will not support other languages than English. That does not mean it won't work, but it will not have been tested at all. We made this decision to prevent a significant increase in complexity.\n* We will not support comparing and relating different contexts to another. E.g. what is the difference between this issue and issue xyz. This is GA scope.\n* We will not support global contexts for repos / issues / epics / etc. This may be covered before GA though.\n\n## Marketing\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/brand-product-marketing/product-marketing/-/issues/7274+s\n\n## Related\n\n* [Research work prioritization for the GitLab Chat in Q2 FY24](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2501#note_1421246798 \"Research Prioritization for Fulfillment, ModelOps, and Analytics - Q2FY24\")\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2604#note_1515310932\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/423325+s\n\n## Literature\n\n(some random links)\n\n* Research result: [Questions users want to ask](https://gitlab.dovetailapp.com/projects/6wL9UBVQCbOpaC6WLu22su/v/ukXfzRL2lbYwiKe5Bbdyu/present/1WktHKngt2oO4NpHzBEf9I)\n* [What parts of development workflow make sense for AI tools](https://stackoverflow.co/labs/developer-sentiment-ai-ml/#h2-what-parts-of-development-workflow-make-sense-for-ai-tools)\n* https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/hard-stuff-nobody-talks-about-llm\n* https://newrelic.com/platform/new-relic-grok\n* https://twitter.com/amanrsanger/status/1660729100137553920\n* Test framework for code suggestions: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415381+",

I have to discuss this with @timzallmann to understand it better. \n* We could reduce the scope of VectorQARetrieval tool to documentation only for the beta release and have ask a question about this repo be done by the SCM team if we find that distribution of work could scale well. \n* Are you saying the WebIDE chat extension is part of Beta or just the API that would enable that, @m_gill.

Please clarify this.\n\nAdditionally, also under [Overall Scope](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10550#overall-scope) I see that the first iteration will enable:\n\n>>>\nChat answers questions relating to\n\n* code the user sees\n* issue the user sees\n* how to use GitLab\n* recent context from chat history (i.e. Conversational Chat enabled)\n>>>\n\nPlease separate this out into it's own section called **Use Cases that will be enabled** and word these statements using the terms that leadership had been referring to them as. The goal is for someone to be able to look at this epic and immediately understand that in the first iteration the following features will be possible:\n\n1. Explain this code\n2. Ask questions about an issue = > _This is new. Please explain what this is since this has not been a feature that we have been broadly discussing for the last couple months_\n3. Conversational Chat\n4. Ask questions of docs\n\nFinally, marketing needs a 2 week aheads up (to the best of your ability) prior to the release of the first iteration. \n\ncc @timzallmann @m_gill",

In fact, we hope that we can have something demoable today or tomorrow, so we can understand how well it works and what is missing for a releasable functionality. I also have requests from @cherryhan to create something that we can demo to a large prospect on Wednesday as we might not win them if we can't show AI capabilities that go beyond code suggestions. \n\n@laurenaalves, once we have that first prototype working we will share it with you. I can work on a blog post. What else do you need from me? Please, check out",
