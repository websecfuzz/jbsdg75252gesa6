Contribute to built-in project templates\\n\\n## Adding a new built-in project template\\n\\nIf you'd like to contribute a new built-in project template to be distributed with GitLab, please do the following:\\n\\n1. Create a new public project with the project content you'd like to contribute in a namespace of your choosing. You can view a working example [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/dotnetcore).\\n   - Projects should be as simple as possible and free of any unnecessary assets or dependencies.\\n1. When the project is ready for review, please create a new issue in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues) with a link to your project.\\n   - In your issue, `@` mention the relevant Backend Engineering Manager and Product Manager for the [Create:Source Code group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#source-code-group).\\n\\nTo make the project template available when creating a new project, the vendoring process will have to be completed:\\n\\n1.

Custom group-level project templates **(PREMIUM ALL)**\\n\\n> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6861) in GitLab 11.6.\\n\\nWhen you create a project, you can [choose from a list of templates](../project/index.md).\\nThese templates, for things like GitLab Pages or Ruby, populate the new project with a copy of the files contained in the\\ntemplate. This information is identical to the information used by [GitLab project import/export](../project/settings/import_export.md)\\nand can help you start a new project more quickly.\\n\\nYou can [customize the list](../project/index.md) of available templates, so\\nthat all projects in your group have the same list. To do this, you populate a subgroup with the projects you want to\\nuse as templates.\\n\\nYou can also configure [custom templates for the instance](../../administration/custom_project_templates.md).\\n\\n## Set up group-level project templates\\n\\nPrerequisite:\\n\\n- You must have the Owner role for the group.\\n\\nTo set up custom project templates in a group, add the subgroup that contains the\\nproject templates to the group settings:\\n\\n1. In the group, create a [subgroup](subgroups/index.md).\\n1. [Add projects to the new subgroup](index.md#add-projects-to-a-group) as your templates.\\n1. In the left menu for the group, select **Settings > General**.\\n1.

In the dropdown list, copy the URL for your repository by selecting **{copy-to-clipboard}** next to:\\n   - **Clone with HTTPS** if your GitLab account uses basic username and password authentication.\\n   - **Clone with SSH** if you use SSH to authenticate with GitLab.\\n1. Now switch to the CLI (Terminal, PowerShell, or similar) on your local machine, and go to\\n   the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, `/users/my-username/my-projects/`.\\n1. Run `git clone` and paste the URL you copied earlier, for example:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   git clone https://gitlab.com/my-username/my-awesome-project.git\\n   ```\\n\\n   This clones the repository into a new directory called `my-awesome-project/`.\\n\\nNow your repository is on your computer, ready for your Git CLI commands!\\n\\n## Fetch and check out your branch\\n\\nNext we need to check out the branch that contains the commits to update.\\n\\n1. Assuming you are still at the same place in the CLI as the previous step,\\n   change to your project directory with `cd`:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   cd my-awesome-project\\n   ```\\n\\n1. Optional. If you've just cloned the repository, your branch should already be\\n   on your computer too. But if you've previously cloned the repository and skipped\\n   to this step, you might need to fetch your branch with:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   git fetch origin my-branch-name\\n   ```\\n\\n1.

Custom instance-level project templates **(PREMIUM SELF)**\\n\\n> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6860) in GitLab 11.2.\\n\\nGitLab administrators can set a group to be the source of project templates that are\\nselectable when a new project is created on the instance. These templates can be selected\\nwhen you go to **New project > Create from template** and select the **Instance** tab.\\n\\nEvery project in the group, but not its subgroups, can be selected when a new project\\nis created, based on the user's access permissions:\\n\\n- Public projects can be selected by any authenticated user as a template for a new project,\\n  if all enabled [project features](../user/project/settings/_index.md#configure-project-visibility-features-and-permissions)\\n  except for **GitLab Pages** and **Security and Compliance** are set to **Everyone With Access**.\\n  The same applies to internal projects.\\n- Private projects can be selected only by users who are members of the projects.\\n\\nThe **Metrics Dashboard** is set to **Only Project Members** when you create a new project.
