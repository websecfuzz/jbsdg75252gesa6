Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing\nCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\nan overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the \"-check\" option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss_v3":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","published_date":"2023-07-31","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3817","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230731.txt","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=6a1eb62c29db6cb5eec707f9338aee00f44e26f5","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9002fd07327a91f35ba6c1307e71fa6fd4409b7f","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=91ddeba0f2269b017dc06c46c993a788974b1aa5","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=869ad69aadd985c7b8ca6f4e5dd0eb274c9f3644","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/31/1","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43"],"identifiers":[{"type":"cve","name":"CVE-2023-3817","value":"CVE-2023-3817","url":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3817"},{"type":"cwe","name":"CWE-1035","value":"1035","url":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1035.html"},{"type":"cwe","name":"CWE-834","value":"834","url":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/834.html"},{"type":"cwe","name":"CWE-937","value":"937","url":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/937.html"}]},"packages":null}
