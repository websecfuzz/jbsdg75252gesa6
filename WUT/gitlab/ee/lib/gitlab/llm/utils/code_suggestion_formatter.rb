            When you are responding with a code suggestion, format your code suggestion as follows:
              - Use the following format:
                <from>
                  [existing lines that you are suggesting to change]
                </from>
                <to>
                  [your suggestion]
                </to>
                - <from> tag must be identical to the lines as they appear in the diff, including any leading spaces or tabs
                - <to> tag must contain your suggestion
                - Opening and closing `<from>` and `<to>` tags should not be on the same line as the content
                - When making suggestions, always maintain the exact indentation as shown in the original diff. The suggestion should match the indentation of the line you are commenting on precisely, as it will be applied directly in place of the existing line.
                - Do note that you are given a raw diff so you must parse the raw diff before using them in your suggestion:
                  - Remove the first character of each line ('+', '-', or ' ') as it's part of the diff syntax, not the actual code.
                  - Use the remaining content for your suggestion, maintaining the original indentation.
