GitLab Duo Chat is your personal AI-native assistant for boosting productivity. GitLab Duo Chat can help with:

* Questions about an issue or an epic, for example:
  * `Summarize this issue in 5 bullet points.`
  * `Rewrite the description of this epic to make to be more concise.`
* Questions about merge requests, for example:
  * `Which files and changes in this merge request should I review first?`
  * `Why was the .vue file changed in <merge request URL>?`
  * _Note: GitLab Duo Chat does not yet have the context of pipelines or commits in an MR._
* Explaining or generating code, for example:
  * `Create a regular expression for parsing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Python.`
  * `Create a CI/CD configuration to build and test Rust code.`
  * `Explain when this C function would cause a segmentation fault: sqlite3_prepare_v2()`
  * [On a code file, select the lines you want explained, then on the left side, select the question mark](#{::Gitlab::Routing.url_helpers.help_page_url('user/project/repository/code_explain.md')}).
* Questions about how GitLab works, for example:
  * `How do I add CI/CD variables to a project?`
* [Troubleshooting a failed pipeline](#{::Gitlab::Routing.url_helpers.help_page_url('user/gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md', anchor: 'troubleshoot-failed-cicd-jobs-with-root-cause-analysis')}) (Requires Ultimate and is part of GitLab Duo Enterprise):
  * On the job log page, select **Troubleshoot** or open GitLab Duo Chat and type `/troubleshoot`.
* [Explain a vulnerability](#{::Gitlab::Routing.url_helpers.help_page_url('user/application_security/vulnerabilities/_index.md', anchor: 'vulnerability-explanation')}) found by a SAST scanner (Requires Ultimate and is part of GitLab Duo Enterprise):
  * In the upper right, from the Resolve with merge request dropdown list, select **Explain vulnerability**, then select **Explain vulnerability**.
  * Or, open GitLab Duo Chat and type `/vulnerability_explain`.

Ask follow-up questions to dig deeper into or expand on the conversation with GitLab Duo. If you want to switch topics, type `/reset` and you might get better results.

Use GitLab Duo Chat in your IDE to explain, create, or refactor code, or to generate tests. After [you set up Chat in your IDE](#{::Gitlab::Routing.url_helpers.help_page_url('user/gitlab_duo_chat/_index.md', anchor: 'use-gitlab-duo-chat-in-the-web-ide')}) type `/help` in the IDE to learn how to use it.

GitLab Duo Chat is your personal AI-native assistant for boosting productivity. You can ask GitLab Duo Chat questions about code by selecting the code and asking a question. GitLab Duo Chat can help with:

* Generating or change code, for example:
  * Select the code that you have a question about and ask your question.
  * `Create a regular expression for parsing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Python.`
  * `Create a CI/CD configuration to build and test Rust code.`
* Explaining code (you can also use `/explain`), for example:
  * Select the code you want explain and then ask questions like the following
  * `Explain when this C function would cause a segmentation fault: sqlite3_prepare_v2()`
  * `/explain why a static variable is used here`
* Refactoring code, (you can also use `/refactor`), for example:
  * Select the code you want refactored and then ask questions like the following
  * `/refactor to avoid memory leaks`
* Fixing code (you can also use `/fix`), for example:
  * Select the code you want fixed and then ask questions like the following
  * `/fix duplicate database inserts`
* Writing tests (you can also use `/tests`), for example:
  * Select the code you want to have tests written for and then ask questions like the following
  * `Write tests using the Boost.test framework`
  * `/tests`
