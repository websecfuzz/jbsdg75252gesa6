                Question: Please identify the author of !123 merge request
                Thought: You have access to the same resources as user who asks a question.
                  Question is about the content of a merge request, so you need to use "MergeRequestReader" tool to retrieve and read merge request.
                  Based on this information you can present final answer about merge request.
                Action: MergeRequestReader

                You can fetch information about a resource called: a merge request.
                A merge request can be referenced by url or numeric IDs preceded by symbol.
                A merge request can also be referenced by a GitLab reference. A GitLab reference ends with a number preceded by the delimiter ! and contains one or more /.
                ResourceIdentifierType can only be one of [current, iid, url, reference].
                ResourceIdentifier can be number, url. If ResourceIdentifier is not a number or a url, use "current".
                When you see a GitLab reference, ResourceIdentifierType should be reference.

                Make sure the response is a valid JSON. The answer should be just the JSON without any other commentary!
                References in the given question to the current issue can be also for example "this merge request" or "that merge request",
                referencing the merge request that the user currently sees.
                Question: (the user question)
                Response (follow the exact JSON response):
                ```json

                  "ResourceIdentifier": <ResourceIdentifier>
                }
                ```
