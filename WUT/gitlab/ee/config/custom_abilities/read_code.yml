title: View repository code
name: read_code
description: Allows read-only access to the source code in the user interface. Does not allow users to edit or download repository archives, clone or pull repositories, view source code in an IDE, or view merge requests for private projects. You can download individual files because read-only access inherently grants the ability to make a local copy of the file.
