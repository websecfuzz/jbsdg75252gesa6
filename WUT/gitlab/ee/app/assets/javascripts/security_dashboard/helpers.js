/**
 * Provided a security reports summary from the GraphQL API, this returns an array of arrays
 * representing a properly formatted report ready to be displayed in the UI. Each sub-array consists
 * of the user-friend report's name, and the summary's payload. Note that summary entries are
 * considered empty and are filtered out of the return if the payload is `null` or don't include
 * a vulnerabilitiesCount property. Report types whose name can't be matched to a user-friendly
 * name are filtered out as well.
 *
 * Take the following summary for example:
 * {
 *   containerScanning: { vulnerabilitiesCount: 123 },
 *   invalidReportType: { vulnerabilitiesCount: 123 },
 *   dast: null,
 * }
 *
 * The formatted summary would look like this:
 * [
 *   ['containerScanning', { vulnerabilitiesCount: 123 }]
 * ]
 *
 * Note that `invalidReportType` was filtered out as it can't be matched with a user-friendly name,
 * and the DAST report was omitted because it's empty (`null`).
 *
 * @param {Object} rawSummary
 * @returns {Array}
