description: We have production work item records with incorrect data that need to be updated.
  This occurred because we weren't updating milestone, weight, health_status, and labels
  when they became empty - for example, we didn't account for workflows where an issue
  gets unassigned from a milestone or has its weight removed
group: group::global search
milestone: '18.2'
