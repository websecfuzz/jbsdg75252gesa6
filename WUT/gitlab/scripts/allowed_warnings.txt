# This warning is emitted by scripts/static-analysis.
\*\*\*\* .+ had the following warning\(s\):

# As of Ruby 3.1, one-line typesafe/destructuring pattern matching via "rightward assignment" has
# been included for multiple years with no significant negative feedback or indications of removal.
# In the event that it is removed in a future Ruby release, the changes required to fix it are
# isolated and minor, and will have no fundamental effect on the logic. See the section
# "Rightward assignment pattern matching and destructuring with types" in
# ee/lib/remote_development/README.md for more information and context.
warning: One-line pattern matching is experimental, and the behavior may change in future versions of Ruby!

# The `io-event` gem is using an experimental feature of Ruby called `IO::Buffer`.
# The maintainer of the gem is also the maintainer of Ruby language and `IO::Buffer` implementation, therefore,
# it's really unlikelly that we will not be able to find a compatible version of the `io-event` gem if the
# experimental `IO::Buffer` feature changes in Ruby.
warning: IO::Buffer is experimental and both the Ruby and C interface may change in the future!

# We need to build the Tailwind CSS bundle before running Stylelint so that we can lint against
# forbidden syntax within the compiled tailwind.css. The Tailwind CSS builder logs some messages
# with `console.error()` which need to be ignored here.
