# Lints against outdated documentation links rendered in the product and enforces extension-less
# paths.
# For now, we disable the cop on all HAML files to not conflict with the `DocumentationLinks` HAML
# linter. We'll eventually consolidate both cops into `Gitlab/DocumentationLinks/Link`.
Gitlab/DocumentationLinks/Link:
  Exclude:
    - app/views/**/*.haml
    - ee/app/views/**/*.haml
