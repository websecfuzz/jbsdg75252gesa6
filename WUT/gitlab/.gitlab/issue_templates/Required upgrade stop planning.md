Instructions:

1. Replace all occurrences of X.Y to the release that is targeted as an upgrade stop.
2. Give the issue a title: "X.Y upgrade stop planning"
3. Replace the <deadline date> with the ISO date 10 days before the [release date](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/) (this is always two Fridays before).

-->

This planning issue collects a list of changes that require an upgrade stop to X.Y.

## Notes for all engineering managers

To help to determine whether %"X.Y" is a required stop,
add your issue to the list below before `<deadline date>` (your local time).

You can review the [Common scenarios that require stops](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/database/required_stops/) and
[avoiding required stops](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/avoiding_required_stops/) to
confirm. If you are still not sure after reviewing the documentation, leave a
comment with the link to your issue or epic in this issue for others to review.

If your change requires an upgrade stop and cannot wait until %"X.Y", please
reach out to `@dorrino` and `@plu8`.
