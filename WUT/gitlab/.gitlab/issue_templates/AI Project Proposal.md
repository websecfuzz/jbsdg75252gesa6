<!--
HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE
To propose an AI experiment, focus on completing the ‚ÄúExperiment‚Äù section first. As you refine the idea and gather feedback on your experiment, progress to the Beta section to define how it will evolve, when ready, progress to the ‚ÄúGenerally Available release‚Äù section to define how it will evolve GA capability. It's important that we link Experiment to Beta to GA release. Feel free to add sections, but the existing ones must be kept and completed.

You can choose how to get started with this template. For example, the proposal can start as an issue, and then be promoted to an epic to house all the work related to the Experiment, Beta, and GA release. If you prefer to start with an epic, you have to manually apply the proposal template. Regardless, if the experiment is eventually prioritized for development, the template content will need to appear in a top-level epic so it can be tracked alongside other prioritized AI experiments.

TITLE FORMAT
ü§ñ [AI Proposal] {Need/outcome} {Beneficiary} {Job/Small Job}

The title should be something that is easily understood that quickly communicates the intent of the project allowing team members to easily understand and recognize the expected work that will be done. A proposal title should combine the beneficiary of the feature/UI, the job it will allow them to accomplish (see https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/#how-to-write-a-jtbd), and their expected outcome when the work is delivered. Well-defined statements are concise without sacrificing the substance of the proposal so that anyone can understand it at a glance. (e.g. {Reduce the effort} {for security teams} {when prioritizing business-critical risks in their assets}).

<details> <summary> Technical needs </summary>

- [ ] Please consider the operational aspects of the feature you are creating. A list of things to think about is in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/403859. We will be improving this process in the future: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/117637#note_1353253349. 
- [ ] @ mention your [AppSec Stable Counterpart](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/) and read the [AI secure coding guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/secure_coding_guidelines/#artificial-intelligence-ai-features)

1. Work estimate and skills needs to build an ML viable feature: To build any ML feature depending on the work, there are many personas that contribute including Data Scientist, NLP engineer, ML Engineer, MLOps Engineer, ML Infra engineers, Fullstack engineer to integrate the ML Services with Gitlab. Post-prototype we would assess the skills needed to build a production-grade ML feature for the prototype.
2. Data Limitation: We would like to upfront validate if we have viable data for the feature including whether we can use the DataOps pipeline of ModelOps or create a custom one. We would want to understand the training data, test data, and feedback data to dial up the accuracy and the limitations of the data.
3. Model Limitation: We would want to understand if we can use an open-source pre-trained model, tune and customize it or start a model from scratch as well. Further, we would assess based on the ModelOps model evaluation framework which would be the right model to use based on the use case.
4. Cost, Scalability, Reliability: We would want to estimate the cost of hosting, serving, inference of the model, and the full end-to-end infrastructure including monitoring and observability.
5. Legal and Ethical Framework: We would want to align with legal and ethical framework like any other ModelOps features to cover the nine principles of responsible ML and any legal support needed.
