# Functional Programming in Ruby

## Overview

The `Gitlab::Fp` module contains support for functional programming patterns ("FP") in Ruby.

It is in the process of being extracted from the `RemoteDevelopment` domain code,
and made available for wider use in the monolith.

See the following sections in the [Remote Development Rails domain developer documentation](../../../ee/lib/remote_development/README.md) for more context:

- ["Functional Programming"](../../../ee/lib/remote_development/README.md#functional-patterns)
- ["Railway Oriented Programming and the Result Class"](../../../ee/lib/remote_development/README.md#railway-oriented-programming-and-the-result-class)
