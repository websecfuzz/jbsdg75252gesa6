# This template is a port of the OpenTofu CI/CD component at
# https://gitlab.com/components/opentofu
# It is generated with the `make backports` command from that project.

# Please make sure to use the component when your project is hosted on GitLab.com
# or when you are willing to mirror the component project into your self-managed
# instance and use it from there.
#
# Attention: This template will be removed in favor of the OpenTofu CI/CD component as soon as components
#            are available for self-managed instances.
