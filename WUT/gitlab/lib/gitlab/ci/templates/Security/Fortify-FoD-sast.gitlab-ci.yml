# Use this pipeline template as a basis for integrating Fortify on Demand Static Application Security Testing(SAST) into your GitLab pipelines.#
# This template demonstrates the steps to prepare the code+dependencies and initiate a scan. As an option, it also supports waiting for the    #
# SAST scan to complete and optinally failing the job. Software Composition Analysis can be also be performed in conjunection with the SAST    #
# scan if that service has been purchased. Users should review inputs and environment variables below to configure scanning for an existing    #
# application in your Fortify on Demand tenant. Additional information is available in the comments throughout the template and the Fortify on #
# Demand, FoD Uploader and ScanCentral Client product documentation. If you need additional assistance with configuration, feel free to create #
# a help ticket in the Fortify on Demand portal.                                                                                               #

    # Update/override PACKAGE_OPTS based on the ScanCentral Client documentation for your project's included tech stack(s). Helpful hints:
    #   ScanCentral Client will download dependencies for maven (-bt mvn) and gradle (-bt gradle).
    #   The current fortify-ci-tools image is Linux only at this time. Msbuild integration is not currently supported.
    #   ScanCentral has additional options that should be set for PHP and Python projects.
    #   For other build tools (-bt none), add your build commands to download necessary dependencies and prepare according to Fortify on Demand Packaging documentation.
    #   ScanCentral Client documentation is located at https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-software-security-center/

    # Update/override the FoDUploader environment variables as needed. For more information on FoDUploader commands, see https://github.com/fod-dev/fod-uploader-java. Helpful hints:
    #   Credentials (FOD_USERNAME, FOD_PAT, FOD_TENANT) are expected as GitLab CICD Variables in the template (masking recommended).
    #   Static scan settings should be configured in Fortify on Demand portal (Automated Audit preference strongly recommended).
    #   FOD_RELEASE_ID is expected as a GitLab CICD Variable.
    #   FOD_UPLOADER_OPTS can be adjusted to wait for scan completion/pull results (-I 1) and control whether to fail the job (-apf).
