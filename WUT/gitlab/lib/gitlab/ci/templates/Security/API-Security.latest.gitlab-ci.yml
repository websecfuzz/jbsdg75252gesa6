# To contribute improvements to CI/CD templates, please follow the Development guide at:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/development/cicd/templates/
# This specific template is located at:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dast-API.latest.gitlab-ci.yml

# To use this template, add the following to your .gitlab-ci.yml file:
#
# include:
#   template: API-Security.latest.gitlab-ci.yml
#
# You also need to add a `dast` stage to your `stages:` configuration. A sample configuration for DAST API:
#
# stages:
#   - build
#   - test
#   - deploy
#   - dast

# Read more about this feature here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast_api/

# Configure API Security scanning with CI/CD variables (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/).
# List of available variables: https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/api_security_testing/configuration/variables/#available-cicd-variables
