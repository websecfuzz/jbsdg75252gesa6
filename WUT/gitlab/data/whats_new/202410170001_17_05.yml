    In response to your feedback, GitLab Duo Chat is now aware of merge requests. Whether you are a reviewer or an author, you can now converse with Chat about a merge request to quickly dig into it, or learn what to do next. Simply open your merge request and open Duo Chat, then start the conversation.
    This new feature complements our exiting feature, where you can quickly populate the description of a merge request by asking GitLab Duo to summarize code changes, so that reviewers can get a general understanding of what the merge request is about.
