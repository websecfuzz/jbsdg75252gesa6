- name: All new rich text editor experience
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    GitLab 16.2 features an all-new rich text editing experience! This new capability is available for everyone, as an alternative to the existing Markdown editing experience.

    For many, using the plain text editor for comments or descriptions is a barrier to collaboration. Remembering the syntax for image references or working with long tables can be tedious even for those who are relatively experienced with the syntax. The rich text editor aims to break down these barriers by providing a "what you see is what you get" editing experience and an extensible foundation on which we can build custom editing interfaces for things like diagrams, content embeds, media management, and more.

    The rich text editor is now available in all issues, epics and merge requests. We plan to make it available in more places across GitLab soon. You can follow our progress [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10378).

    We are proud of the new editing experience and can't wait to see what you think. Please try the new rich text editor and let us know about your experience in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416293).

- name: Support for Keyless Signing with Cosign
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Properly storing, rotating, and managing signing keys can be difficult and typically requires the overhead of managing a separate Key Management System (KMS). GitLab now supports keyless signing through a native integration with the Sigstore Cosign tool which allows for easy, convenient, and secure signing within the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.  Signing is done using a very short-lived signing key. The key is generated through a token obtained from the GitLab server using the OIDC identity of the user who ran the pipeline. This token includes unique claims that certify the token was generated by a CI/CD pipeline.

    To begin using keyless signing for your build artifacts, container images, and packages, users only need to add a few lines to their CI/CD file as [shown in our documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/signing_examples.html).

- name: Command palette
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    If you're a power user, using the keyboard to navigate and take action can be frustrating. Now, a new command palette helps you use the keyboard to get more done.

    To enable the command palette, open the left sidebar and click  **Search GitLab** (üîç) or use the <kbd>/</kbd> key.

    Type one of the special characters:

    * <kbd>></kbd> - Create a new object or find a menu item
    * <kbd>@</kbd> - Search for a user
    * <kbd>:</kbd> - Search for a project
    * <kbd>/</kbd> - Search for project files in the default repository branch

- name: New customization layer for the Value Streams Dashboard
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    We added a new configuration file to the [Value Streams Dashboard](https://youtu.be/EA9Sbks27g4) for easier customization of the dashboard's data and appearance. In this file you can define various settings and parameters, such as title, description, and number of panels and filters. The file is schema-driven and managed with version control systems like Git. This enables tracking and maintaining a history of configuration changes, reverting to previous versions if necessary, and collaborating effectively with team members.

    The new configuration also includes the option to filter the metrics by labels. You can adjust the [metrics comparison panel](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/06/12/getting-started-with-value-streams-dashboard/) based on your areas of interest, filter out irrelevant information, and focus on the data that is most relevant to your analysis or decision-making process.

- name: Interactive diff suggestions in merge requests
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    When you suggest changes in a merge request, you can now edit your suggestions more quickly. In a comment, switch to the rich text editor and use the UI to move up and down the lines of text. With this change, you can view your suggestions exactly as they will appear when the comment is posted.

    The rich text editor is a new way of editing in GitLab. It's available in merge requests, but also available alongside the plain text editor in issues and epics.

    We plan to have the rich text editor available in more areas of GitLab soon and we are actively working on that. You can follow our progress [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10378).
