- name: Value Streams Dashboard is now generally available
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    This [new dashboard](https://youtu.be/EA9Sbks27g4) provides strategic insights into metrics that help decision-makers identify trends and patterns to optimize software delivery. The first iteration of the GitLab Value Streams Dashboard is focused on enabling teams to continuously improve software delivery workflows by benchmarking value stream life cycle ([value stream analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/value_stream_analytics/), [DORA4](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html)), and [vulnerabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/) metrics.

    Organizations can use the [Value Streams Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/value_streams_dashboard.html) to track and compare these metrics over a period of time, identify downward trends early, understand security exposure, and drill down into individual projects or metrics to take actions for improvements.

    This comprehensive view built as a single application with a unified data store allows all stakeholders, from executives to individual contributors, to have visibility into the software development life cycle, without needing to buy or maintain a third-party tool.

  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    You asked, we listened! In our efforts to be best-in-class for CI/CD build speeds, we're doubling the vCPU & RAM for all GitLab SaaS runners on Linux, with no increase in the [cost factor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/compute_minutes.html#cost-factor).

    We're excited to see pipelines run faster and boost productivity.

  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    We are aiming to bring the best practices of DevSecOps to data sciences by providing more powerful compute hardware within GitLab runner. Previously, data scientists may have had workloads that were compute-intensive and as a result, jobs may not have been as quickly executed in GitLab.

    Now, with GPU-enabled SaaS runners on Linux, these workloads can be seamlessly supported using GitLab.com.

    So why wait? Try out the new runner today and let us know what you think in this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/403008). We can't wait to hear your feedback!

- name: Comment templates
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    When you're commenting in issues, epics, or merge requests you might repeat yourself and need to write the same comment over and over. Maybe you always need to ask for more information about a bug report. Maybe you're applying labels via a quick action as part of a triage process. Or maybe you just like to finish all your code reviews with a funny gif or appropriate emoji. ðŸŽ‰

    Comment templates enable you to create saved responses that you can apply in comment boxes around GitLab to speed up your workflow. To create a comment template, go to **User settings > Comment templates** and then fill out your template. After it's saved, select the **Insert comment template** icon on any text area, and your saved response will be applied.

    This is a great way to standardize your replies and save you time!

- name: Update your fork from the GitLab UI
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Managing your fork just got easier. When your fork is behind, select **Update fork** in the GitLab UI to catch it up with upstream changes. When your fork is ahead, select **Create merge request** to contribute your change back to the upstream project. Both operations previously required you to use the command line.

    See how many commits your fork is ahead (or behind) on your project's main page and at **Repository > Files**. If merge conflicts exist, the UI gives guidance on how to resolve them using Git from the command line.

    Do you need to mirror a busy repository with many branches, but you only need a few of them? Limit the number of branches you mirror by creating a regular expression that matches only the branches you need.

    Previously, mirrors required you to mirror an entire repository, or all protected branches. This new flexibility can decrease the amount of data your mirrors push or pull, and keep sensitive branches out of public mirrors.

- name: New Web IDE experience now generally available
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Since its introduction, we've been iterating on the usability, performance, and stability of the Web IDE, which has enabled us to build features like remote development workspaces and code suggestions on a powerful foundation.

    We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the Web IDE Beta and starting in GitLab 16.0, we are making it the default multi-file code editor across GitLab.

- name: Remote development workspaces available in Beta for public projects
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Stop spending hours, or even days, troubleshooting your local development environment and interpreting inscrutable package installation errors. Now you can define a consistent, stable, and secure development environment in code and use it to create on-demand, remote development workspaces.

    These workspaces serve as personal, ephemeral development environments in the cloud. By eliminating the need for a local development environment, you can focus more on your code and less on your dependencies. Accelerate the process of onboarding to a new project and get up and running in minutes instead of days.

    After the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes is configured and [the dependencies are installed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/workspace/#prerequisites) in your self-hosted cluster or cloud platform of choice, you can define your development environment in a `.devfile.yaml` file and store it in a public project. Then, you and any other developers with access to the agent can create a workspace based on the `.devfile.yaml` file and edit directly in the embedded Web IDE. You'll have full terminal access to the container, allowing you to work more efficiently. When you're done, or if something goes wrong, you can shut down the workspace and start a fresh, new workspace for your next development task.

    This short video walks you through the lifecycle of a workspace in the current Beta. Learn more about workspaces in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/workspace/) and let us know what you think in the [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410031).

- name: Security training with SecureFlag
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    As security shifts left, remediating security findings without guidance can be challenging. Developers need actionable advice so they can resolve vulnerabilities and continue building features. Contextual training that is relevant to the specific vulnerabilty detected was released in GitLab 14.9.

    In this release, we are adding an integration with SecureFlag based upon the CWE of the vulnerability. SecureFlag's training solution is unique in that the labs involve remediating the vulnerability in a live environment, which can be transferred to a real environment.

- name: Code Suggestions improvements
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Code Suggestions is now available on GitLab.com for all users for free while the feature is in Beta. Teams can boost efficiency with the help of generative AI that suggests code while you're developing.

    We've extended language support from our initial six languages to now include 13 languages: C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Kotlin, and TypeScript.

    We are making improvements to the Code Suggestions underlying AI model weekly to improve the quality of suggestions. Please remember that AI is non-deterministic, so you may not get the same suggestion week to week.
