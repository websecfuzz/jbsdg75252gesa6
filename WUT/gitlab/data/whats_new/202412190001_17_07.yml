- name: Instance administrators can control which integrations can be enabled
  description: |
    Instance administrators can now configure an allowlist to control which integrations can be enabled on a GitLab instance. If an empty allowlist is configured, no integrations are allowed on the instance. After an allowlist is configured, new GitLab integrations are not on the allowlist by default.  Previously enabled integrations that are later blocked by the allowlist settings are disabled. If these integrations are allowed again, they are re-enabled with their existing configuration.

    Reassign memberships and contributions to existing users on the destination instance after the import has completed.

- name: Auto-resolve vulnerabilities when not found in subsequent scans
  description: |
    We are introducing a new policy type _Vulnerability Management policy_ for users who want vulnerabilities automatically set to Resolved when no longer detected by automated scanning. Simply configure a new policy with the new Auto-resolve option and apply it to the appropriate project(s). You can even configure the policy to only Auto-resolve vulnerabilities of a certain severity or from specific security scanners. Once in place, the next time the project's default branch is scanned, any existing vulnerabilities that are no longer found will be marked as Resolved. The action updates the vulnerability record with an activity note, timestamp when the action occurred, and the pipeline the vulnerability was determined to be removed in.
