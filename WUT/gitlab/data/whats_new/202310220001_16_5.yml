- name: Compliance standards adherence report
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    The Compliance Center now includes a new tab for the standards adherence report.
    This report initially includes a GitLab best practices standard, showing when the
    projects in your group are not meeting the requirements for the checks included in the standard. The
    three checks shown initially are:

    - Approval rule exists to require at least 2 approvers on MRs
    - Approval rule exists to disallow the MR author to merge
    - Approval rule exists to disallow committers to the MR to merge

    The report contains details on the status of each check on a per project basis. It will
    also show you when the check was last run, which standard the check applies to,
    and how to fix any failures or problems that might be shown on the report. Future iterations
    will add more checks and expand the scope to include more regulations and standards.
    Additionally, we will be adding improvements to group and filter the report, so you
    can focus on the projects or standards that matter most to your organization.

- name: Create rules to set target branches for merge requests
  description: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Some projects use multiple long-term branches for development, like `develop` and `qa`. In these projects, you might want to keep `main` as the default branch since it represents the production state of the project. However, development work expects merge requests to target `develop` or `qa`. Target branch rules help ensure merge requests target the appropriate branch for your project and development workflow.

    When you create a merge request, the rule checks the name of the branch. If the branch name matches the rule, the merge request pre-selects the branch you specified in the rule as the target. If the branch name does not match, the merge request targets the default branch of the project.

    In 16.4, we released [Fast-forward merge trains](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/09/22/gitlab-16-4-released/#fast-forward-merge-support-for-merge-trains), and as a continuation, we want to ensure we support all [merge methods](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/methods/). Now, if you want to ensure your semi-linear commit history is maintained you can use Semi-linear fast-forward merge trains.
