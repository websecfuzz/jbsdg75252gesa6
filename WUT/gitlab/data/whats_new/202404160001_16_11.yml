- name: Understand your users better with Product Analytics
  description: |
    With the new Product Analytics feature, you can instrument your applications, collect key usage and adoption data about your users, and then display it inside GitLab.

    You can visualize data in dashboards, report on it, and filter it in a variety of different ways to find insights about your users. Your team can now quickly identify and respond to unexpected dips or spikes in customer usage that signify an issue, as well as celebrate the success of their recent releases.

- name: Security policy scopes
  description: |
    Policy scoping provides granular management and enforcement of policies. Across both merge request approval (scan result) policies and scan execution policies, this new feature enables security and compliance teams to scope policy enforcement to a compliance framework or to a set of included/excluded projects in a group.

    While today all policies managed in a security policy project are enforced against all linked groups, subgroups, and projects, policy scoping will allow you to refine that enforcement policy by policy.

- name: Disable personal access tokens for Enterprise Users
  description: |
    GitLab.com group Owners can now disable the creation and use of personal access tokens for any enterprise users in their groups. Due to the powerful privileges that can be associated with personal access tokens, some Owners may want to disable these tokens for security reasons.

    This granular control gives options when it comes to balancing security and accessibility on GitLab.com.

    We're thrilled to introduce autocomplete support for links to wiki pages in GitLab 16.11! With this new feature, linking to wiki pages from your epics and issues
    has never been easier - it's just a matter of a few keystrokes.

    Gone are the days of having to copy and paste wiki page URLs into epic and issue comments. Now, simply navigate to any group or project with wiki pages, access an epic or
    issue, and use the autocomplete shortcut to seamlessly link to your wiki pages from the epic or issue!

- name: Option to cancel a pipeline immediately if any jobs fails
  description: |
    Sometimes after you notice a job fails, you might manually cancel the rest of the pipeline to save resources while you work on the issue causing the failure. With GitLab 16.11, you can now configure pipelines to be canceled automatically when any job fails. With large pipelines that take a long time to run, especially with many long-running jobs that run in parallel, this can be an effective way to reduce resource usage and costs.

    You can even configure a pipeline to immediately [cancel if a downstream pipeline fails](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.html#auto-cancel-the-parent-pipeline-from-a-downstream-pipeline), which cancels the parent pipeline and all other downstream pipelines.

    Special thanks to [Marco](https://gitlab.com/zillemarco) for contributing to the feature!
