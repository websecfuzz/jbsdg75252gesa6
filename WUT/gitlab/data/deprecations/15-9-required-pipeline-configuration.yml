    Required pipeline configuration will be removed in GitLab 17.0. This impacts users on GitLab Self-Managed on the Ultimate tier.

    You should replace required pipeline configuration with either:

    - [Security policies scoped to compliance frameworks](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/scan_execution_policies/#security-policy-scopes), which are experimental.
    - [Compliance pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/compliance_pipelines/), which are available now.

    We recommend these alternative solutions because they provides greater flexibility, allowing required pipelines to be assigned to specific
    compliance framework labels.

    Compliance pipelines will be deprecated in the future and migrated to security policies. For more information, see the
    [migration and deprecation epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11275).
