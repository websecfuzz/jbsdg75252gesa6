    - For Linux package (Omnibus) installations, the [`sidekiq['min_concurrency']` and `sidekiq['max_concurrency']`](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/extra_sidekiq_processes/#manage-thread-counts-explicitly) settings are deprecated in GitLab 16.9 and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

      You can use `sidekiq['concurrency']` in GitLab 16.9 and later to set thread counts explicitly in each process.

      The above change only applies to Linux package (Omnibus) installations.

    - For GitLab Helm chart installations, passing `SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY_MIN` and/or `SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY_MAX` as `extraEnv` to the `sidekiq` sub-chart is deprecated in GitLab 16.10 and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

      You can use the `concurrency` option to set thread counts explicitly in each process.
