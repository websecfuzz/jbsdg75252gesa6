    The `DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT` environment variable determines how long a DAST scan waits for a response from the browser. Before GitLab 18.0, the variable has a static value of 45 seconds. After GitLab 18.0, `DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT` environment variable has a dynamic value, which is calculated based on other timeout configurations.
    In most cases, the 45-second value was higher than the timeout value of many scanner functions. The dynamically calculated value makes the `DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT` variable more useful by increasing the number of cases it applies to.

    To lessen potential disruptions, we will incrementally adjust the default timeout value according to this schedule:

    | Timeout value | Milestone         |
    |:--------------|:------------------|
    | 45            | 17.11 and earlier |
    | 30            | 18.0              |
    | 20            | 18.1              |
    | 10            | 18.2              |
    | 5             | 18.3              |
