    Supporting very old versions of sbt is preventing us from improving our support for additional use cases with this package manager without increasing our maintenance cost.

    Version 1.1.0 of sbt was released 6 years ago, and users are advised to upgrade from 1.0.x as Dependency Scanning will no longer work.
