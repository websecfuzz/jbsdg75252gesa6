    Registration tokens and certain configuration arguments in the command `gitlab-runner register` that [registers](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) a runner, are deprecated.
    Authentication tokens will be used to register runners instead. Registration tokens, and support for certain configuration arguments,
    will be removed in a future GitLab release. For more information, see [Migrating to the new runner registration workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow/).
    The configuration arguments disabled for authentication tokens are:

    - `--locked`
    - `--access-level`
    - `--run-untagged`
    - `--maximum-timeout`
    - `--paused`
    - `--tag-list`
    - `--maintenance-note`

    This change is a breaking change. You should [create a runner in the UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/runners_scope/) to add configurations, and use the authentication token in the `gitlab-runner register` command instead.
  end_of_support_milestone:  # (optional) Use "XX.YY" format. The milestone when support for this feature will end.
