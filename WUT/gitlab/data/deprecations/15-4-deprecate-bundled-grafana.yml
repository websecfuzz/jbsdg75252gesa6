    In GitLab 15.4, we will be swapping the bundled Grafana to a fork of Grafana maintained by GitLab.

    There was an [identified CVE for Grafana](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31107), and to mitigate this security vulnerability, we must swap to our own fork because the older version of Grafana we were bundling is no longer receiving long-term support.

    This is not expected to cause any incompatibilities with the previous version of Grafana. Neither when using our bundled version, nor when using an external instance of Grafana.
