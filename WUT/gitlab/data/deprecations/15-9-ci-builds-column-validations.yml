    While CI/CD [job names](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/#job-name) have a strict 255 character limit, other CI/CD parameters do not yet have validations ensuring they also stay under the limit.

    In GitLab 16.0, validation will be added to strictly limit the following to 255 characters as well:

    - The `stage` keyword.
    - The `ref`, which is the Git branch or tag name for the pipeline.
    - The `description` and `target_url` parameter, used by external CI/CD integrations.

    Users on GitLab Self-Managed should update their pipelines to ensure they do not use parameters that exceed 255 characters. Users on GitLab.com do not need to make any changes, as these are already limited in that database.
