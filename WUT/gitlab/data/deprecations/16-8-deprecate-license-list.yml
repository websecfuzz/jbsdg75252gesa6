    Today in GitLab you can see a list of all of the licenses your project and the components that
    use that license on the License List. As of 16.8, the License List
    is deprecated and scheduled to be removed in 17.0 as a breaking change.
    With the release of the [Group Dependency List](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_list/)
    and the ability to filter by license on the project and group Dependency List, you can now
    access all of the licenses your project or group is using on the Dependency List.
