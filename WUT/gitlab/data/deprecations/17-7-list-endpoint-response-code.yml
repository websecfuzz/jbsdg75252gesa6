    In GitLab 17.7, the error handling behavior for the list repository tree API endpoint, `/projects/:id/repository/tree`, is updated when a requested path is not found. The endpoint now returns a status code `404 Not Found`. Previously, the status code was `200 OK`.

    This change was enabled on GitLab.com in GitLab 16.5, and will be available for self-managed instances in GitLab 17.7.

    If your implementation relies on receiving a `200` status code with an empty array for missing paths, you must update your error handling to handle the new `404` responses.
