    The legacy Vue-based GitLab Web IDE implementation will be removed from GitLab.
    This change follows our successful transition to the GitLab VSCode Fork-based Web IDE,
    which has been the default Web IDE experience since GitLab 15.11.

    This removal affects users who are still accessing the legacy Web IDE implementation.

    To prepare for this removal, enable the `vscode_web_ide` feature flag on your GitLab instance
    if it was previously disabled in the GitLab instance.
