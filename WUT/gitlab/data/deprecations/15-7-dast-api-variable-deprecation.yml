    With the switch to the new DAST API analyzer in GitLab 15.6, two legacy DAST API variables are being deprecated. The variables `DAST_API_HOST_OVERRIDE` and `DAST_API_SPECIFICATION` will no longer be used for DAST API scans.

    `DAST_API_HOST_OVERRIDE` has been deprecated in favor of using the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL` to automatically override the host in the OpenAPI specification.

    `DAST_API_SPECIFICATION` has been deprecated in favor of `DAST_API_OPENAPI`. To continue using an OpenAPI specification to guide the test, users must replace the `DAST_API_SPECIFICATION` variable with the `DAST_API_OPENAPI` variable. The value can remain the same, but the variable name must be replaced.

    These two variables will be removed in GitLab 16.0.
