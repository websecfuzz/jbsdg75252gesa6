    Runners generate provenance metadata and currently defaults to generating statements that adhere to SLSA v0.2. Because SLSA v1.0 has been released and is now supported by GitLab, the v0.2 statement is now deprecated and removal is planned in GitLab 17.0. The SLSA v1.0 statement is planned to become the new default statement format in GitLab 17.0.
