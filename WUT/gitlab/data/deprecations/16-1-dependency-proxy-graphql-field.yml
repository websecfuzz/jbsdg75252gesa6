    You can use GraphQL to query the amount of storage used by the GitLab Dependency Proxy. However, the `dependencyProxyTotalSizeInBytes` field is limited to about 2 gigabytes, which is not always large enough for the Dependency Proxy. As a result, `dependencyProxyTotalSizeInBytes` is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

    Use `dependencyProxyTotalSizeBytes` instead, introduced in GitLab 16.1.
