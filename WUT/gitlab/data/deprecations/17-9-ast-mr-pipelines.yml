    In GitLab 18.0, we'll update the default behavior of the CI/CD template for API Discovery (`API-Discovery.gitlab-ci.yml`).

    Before GitLab 18.0, this template configures jobs to run in [merge request (MR) pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines/) by default when an MR is open.
    Starting in GitLab 18.0, we'll align this template's behavior with the behavior of the [Stable template editions](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/detect/roll_out_security_scanning/#template-editions) for other AST scanners:

    - By default, the template will run scan jobs in branch pipelines.
    - You'll be able to set the CI/CD variable `AST_ENABLE_MR_PIPELINES: true` to use MR pipelines instead when an MR is open. The implementation of this new variable is tracked in [issue 410880](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410880).
