    The ability for Developers to change the status of vulnerabilities is now deprecated. We plan to make a breaking change in the upcoming GitLab 17.0 release to remove this ability from the Developer role. Users who wish to continue to grant this permission to developers can [create a custom role](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/permissions/#custom-roles) for their developers and add in the `admin_vulnerability` permission to give them this access.
