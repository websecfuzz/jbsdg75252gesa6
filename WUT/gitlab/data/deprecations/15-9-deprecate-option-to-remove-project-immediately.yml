    The group and project deletion protection setting in the **Admin** area had an option to delete groups and projects immediately. Starting with 16.0, this option will no longer be available, and delayed group and project deletion will become the default behavior.

    The option will no longer appear as a group setting. Users on GitLab Self-Managed will still have the option to define the deletion delay period, and GitLab.com users have a non-adjustable default retention period of 7 days. Users can still immediately delete the project from the project settings, and the group from the group settings.

    The option to delete groups and projects immediately by default was deprecated to prevent users from accidentally taking this action and permanently losing groups and projects.
