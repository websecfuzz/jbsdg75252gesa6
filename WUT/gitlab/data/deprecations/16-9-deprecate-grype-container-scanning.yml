    Support for the Grype scanner in the GitLab Container Scanning analyzer is deprecated in
    GitLab 16.9.

    From GitLab 17.0, the Grype analyzer will no longer be maintained, except for limited fixes as
    explained in our [statement of support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#version-support).

    Users are advised to use the default setting for `CS_ANALYZER_IMAGE`, which uses the Trivy
    scanner.

    The existing current major version for the Grype analyzer image will continue to be updated
    with the latest advisory database, and operating system packages until GitLab 19.0, at which
    point the analyzer will stop working.

    To continue to use Grype past 19.0, see the [Security scanner integration documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/integrations/secure/)
    to learn how to create your own integration with GitLab.
