    Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 reached [end of maintenance support in June 2024](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/rhel-7-end-of-maintenance).

    Therefore, we will no longer publish Linux packages for RHEL 7 and RHEL 7 compatible operating systems.
    Users should upgrade to RHEL 8 for continued support.
