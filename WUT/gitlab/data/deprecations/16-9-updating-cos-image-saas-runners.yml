    GitLab is upgrading the container-optimized operating system (COS) of the ephemeral VMs used to execute jobs for GitLab.com runners on Linux.
    That COS upgrade includes a Docker Engine upgrade from Version 19.03.15 to Version 23.0.5, which introduces a known compatibility issue.

    Docker-in-Docker prior to version 20.10 or Kaniko images older than v1.9.0, will be unable to detect the container runtime and fail.
