   This change affects you only if you're using the
   [GitLab NGINX chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/nginx/), and
   you have set your own NGINX RBAC rules.

   If you're using your own
   [external NGINX chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-nginx/),
   or you're using the GitLab NGINX chart without any NGINX RBAC rules
   changes, this deprecation doesn't apply to you.
   {{< /alert >}}

   In GitLab 17.6 (Helm chart 8.6), the GitLab chart updated the default NGINX
   controller image from version 1.3.1 to 1.11.2. This new version requires new
   RBAC rules that were added to our GitLab NGINX chart, so you'll need to
   ultimately create those rules. This change is also backported to:

   - GitLab 17.5.1 (Helm chart 8.5.1)
   - GitLab 17.4.3 (Helm chart 8.4.3)
   - GitLab 17.3.6 (Helm chart 8.3.6)

   {{< alert type="note" >}}

   The latest patch versions of Helm chart 8.3 to 8.7 contain the NGINX
   controller version 1.11.2.
   Later chart versions include version 1.11.5, since it contains various
   security fixes. GitLab 18.0 will default to controller version 1.11.5.

   {{< /alert >}}

   If you manage your own NGINX RBAC rules, it means that you have set
   `nginx-ingress.rbac.create` to `false`. In that case, from GitLab 17.3 (Helm
   chart 8.3) up until GitLab 17.11 (Helm chart 8.11), there's a fallback
   mechanism that detects that change and uses the old controller image,
   which means you don't need to make any RBAC rules changes.

   Starting with GitLab 18.0 (Helm chart 9.0), this fallback mechanism will
   be removed, so the new controller image will be used and the new RBAC
   rules must exist.

   If you want to take advantage of the new NGINX controller image before it's
   enforced in GitLab 18.0:

   1. Add the new RBAC rules to your cluster [see an example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/3901/diffs?commit_id=93a3cbdb5ad83db95e12fa6c2145df0800493d8b).
   1. Set `nginx-ingress.controller.image.disableFallback` to `true`.
