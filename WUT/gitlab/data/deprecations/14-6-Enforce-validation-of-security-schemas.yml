    [Security report schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/releases)
    versions earlier than 14.0.0 will no longer be supported in GitLab 15.0. Reports that do not pass validation
    against the schema version declared in the report will also no longer be supported in GitLab 15.0.

    Security tools that [integrate with GitLab by outputting security reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/integrations/secure/#report)
    as pipeline job artifacts are affected. You must ensure that all output reports adhere to the correct
    schema with a minimum version of 14.0.0. Reports with a lower version or that fail to validate
    against the declared schema version will not be processed, and vulnerability
    findings will not display in MRs, pipelines, or Vulnerability Reports.

    To help with the transition, from GitLab 14.10, non-compliant reports will display a
    [warning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335789#note_672853791)
    in the Vulnerability Report.
