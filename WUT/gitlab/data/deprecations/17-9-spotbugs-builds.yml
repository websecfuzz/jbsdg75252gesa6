    The SpotBugs [SAST analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks)
    can perform a build when the artifacts to be scanned aren't present. While this usually works well for simple projects, it can fail on more complex builds.

    From GitLab 18.0, to resolve SpotBugs analyzer build failures, you should:

    1. [Pre-compile](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#pre-compilation) the project.
    1. Pass the artifacts you want to scan to the analyzer.

    This is not a change in functionality, so we have marked this announcement "Cancelled" for clarity.
