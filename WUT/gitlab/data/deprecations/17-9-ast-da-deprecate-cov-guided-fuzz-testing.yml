    Coverage-guided fuzz testing is deprecated and will not be supported
    from GitLab 18.0. The feature will be completely removed in GitLab 19.0.

    Coverage-guided fuzz testing integrated several open-source fuzzers into GitLab.
    If you are impacted, you can integrate your open-source fuzzers as standalone applications,
    or migrate to another security feature like [GitLab Advanced SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast.html).
