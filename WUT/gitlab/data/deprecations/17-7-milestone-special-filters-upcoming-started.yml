    The behavior of "Upcoming" and "Started" special filters is planned to change in upcoming GitLab major release 18.0.
    The new behavior of both the filters is outlined in
    [issue 429728](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/429728#proposed-issue-filter-logic-for-upcoming-and-started-milestones).

    This change does not impact the GitLab REST API, which will continue to use the existing milestone filtering logic.
    The GitLab GraphQL API will be updated to adhere to the new filtering logic.
