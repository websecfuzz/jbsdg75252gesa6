    With the new browser-based DAST analyzer GA in GitLab 15.7, we are working towards making it the default DAST analyzer at some point in the future. In preparation for this, the following legacy DAST variables are being deprecated and scheduled for removal in GitLab 16.0: `DAST_HTML_REPORT`, `DAST_XML_REPORT`, and `DAST_MARKDOWN_REPORT`. These reports relied on the legacy DAST analyzer and we do not plan to implement them in the new browser-based analyzer. As of GitLab 16.0, these report artifacts will no longer be generated.

    These three variables will be removed in GitLab 16.0.
