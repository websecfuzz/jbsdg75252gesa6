    Exporting Sidekiq metrics and health checks using a single process and port is deprecated.
    Support will be removed in 15.0.

    We have updated Sidekiq to export [metrics and health checks from two separate processes](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6409)
    to improve stability and availability and prevent data loss in edge cases.
    As those are two separate servers, a configuration change will be required in 15.0
    to explicitly set separate ports for metrics and health-checks.
    The newly introduced settings for `sidekiq['health_checks_*']`
    should always be set in `gitlab.rb`.
    For more information, check the documentation for [configuring Sidekiq](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/).

    These changes also require updates in either Prometheus to scrape the new endpoint or k8s health-checks to target the new
    health-check port to work properly, otherwise either metrics or health-checks will disappear.

    For the deprecation period those settings are optional
    and GitLab will default the Sidekiq health-checks port to the same port as `sidekiq_exporter`
    and only run one server (not changing the current behavior).
    Only if they are both set and a different port is provided, a separate metrics server will spin up
    to serve the Sidekiq metrics, similar to the way Sidekiq will behave in 15.0.
