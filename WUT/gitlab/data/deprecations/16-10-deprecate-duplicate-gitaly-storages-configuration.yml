    Support for configuring multiple Gitaly storages that point to the same storage path is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 17.0
    In GitLab 17.0 and later, this type of configuration will cause an error.

    We're removing support for this type of configuration because it can cause problems with background repository
    maintenance and will not be compatible with future Gitaly storage implementations.

    Instance administrators must update the `storage` entries of the `gitaly['configuration']`
    section in `gitlab.rb` configuration file to ensure each storage is configured with a unique path.
