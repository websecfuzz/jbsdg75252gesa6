    To make it simpler and more reliable to [customize GitLab Secret Detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/#customizing-settings), we're deprecating some of the variables that you could previously set in your CI/CD configuration.

    The following variables currently allow you to customize the options for historical scanning, but interact poorly with the [GitLab-managed CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml) and are now deprecated:

    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_FROM`
    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_TO`
    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS`
    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS_FILE`

    The `SECRET_DETECTION_ENTROPY_LEVEL` previously allowed you to configure rules that only considered the entropy level of strings in your codebase, and is now deprecated.
    This type of entropy-only rule created an unacceptable number of incorrect results (false positives) and is no longer supported.

    In GitLab 15.0, we'll update the Secret Detection [analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/terminology/#analyzer) to ignore these deprecated options.
    You'll still be able to configure historical scanning of your commit history by setting the [`SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN` CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/#available-cicd-variables).
