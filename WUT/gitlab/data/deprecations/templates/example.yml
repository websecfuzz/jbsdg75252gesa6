    <!-- START OF BODY COMMENT

    This area supports markdown. Replace this comment with your markdown content.

    Explain, *briefly*, the details or reasons for the change. Deprecations and other planned changes should be actionable, so tell users how to address the change. For example:

    - "Use the `internal` keyword instead of `confidential`."
    - "Stop using the `omniauth_crowd` gem. It will be removed and will not be replaced."

    When ready, assign to your tech writer for review. They will run `bin/rake gitlab:docs:compile_deprecations` to update the deprecations doc, then merge.
