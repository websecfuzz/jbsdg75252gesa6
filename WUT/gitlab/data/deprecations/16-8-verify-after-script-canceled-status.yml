    The [`after_script`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#after_script) CI/CD keyword is used to run additional commands after the main `script` section of a job. This is often used for cleaning up environments or other resources that were used by the job. For many users, the fact that the `after_script` commands do not run if a job is canceled was unexpected and undesired. In 17.0, the keyword will be updated to also run commands after job cancellation. Make sure that your CI/CD configuration that uses the `after_script` keyword is able to handle running for canceled jobs as well.
