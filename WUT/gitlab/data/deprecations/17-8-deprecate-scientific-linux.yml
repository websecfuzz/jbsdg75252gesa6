    Long term service and support (LTSS) for [Scientific Linux 7 ended in June 2024](https://scientificlinux.org/downloads/sl-versions/sl7/).

    Therefore, we will no longer support the Scientific Linux distribution for Linux package installs. Users should upgrade to
    another RHEL-compatible operating system.
