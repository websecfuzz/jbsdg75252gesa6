    The `projectFingerprint` field in the [`PipelineSecurityReportFinding`](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/graphql/reference/#pipelinesecurityreportfinding)
    GraphQL object is being deprecated. This field contains a "fingerprint" of security findings used to determine uniqueness.
    The method for calculating fingerprints has changed, resulting in different values. Going forward, the new values will be
    exposed in the UUID field. Data previously available in the `projectFingerprint` field will eventually be removed entirely.
