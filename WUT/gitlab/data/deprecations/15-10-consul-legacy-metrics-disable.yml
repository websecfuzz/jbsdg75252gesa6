    The Consul provided in the Linux package will no longer provide older deprecated Consul metrics starting in GitLab 16.0.

    In GitLab 14.0, [Consul was updated to 1.9.6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/5344),
    which deprecated some telemetry metrics from being at the `consul.http` path. In GitLab 16.0, the `consul.http` path will be removed.

    If you have monitoring that consumes Consul metrics, update them to use `consul.api.http` instead of `consul.http`.
    For more information, see [the deprecation notes for Consul 1.9.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.9.0).
