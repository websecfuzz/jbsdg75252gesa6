    We are deprecating the built-in pull-based deployment features of the GitLab agent for Kubernetes in favor of Flux and related integrations.

    The GitLab agent for Kubernetes **is not deprecated**. This change affects only the pull-based functionality of the agent. All other functionality will remain intact, and GitLab will continue to support the agent for Kubernetes.

    If you use the agent for pull-based deployments, you should [migrate to Flux](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/agent/gitops/agent/#migrate-to-flux). Because Flux is a mature CNCF project for GitOps, we decided to [integrate Flux with GitLab in February 2023](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/02/08/why-did-we-choose-to-integrate-fluxcd-with-gitlab/).
