    The [`runnerRegistrationToken`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes/) parameter to use the GitLab Helm Chart to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated.

    We plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance leveraging `runnerToken`
    as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow/).
    The work is planned in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7633).

    In a future GitLab release, the methods to register runners introduced by the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be the only supported methods.
  end_of_support_milestone:  # (optional) Use "XX.YY" format. The milestone when support for this feature will end.
