    The `name` field in the `ProjectMonthlyUsageType` of the GitLab GraphQL API will be removed in GitLab 18.0.

    To prepare for this change, we recommend reviewing and updating your GraphQL queries that interact with the `ProjectMonthlyUsageType`. Replace any references to the `name` field with `project.name`.
