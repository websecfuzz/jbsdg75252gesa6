    We have recently announced the release of Windows Server 2022 for our GitLab.com runners on Windows (Beta). With it, we are deprecating Windows 2019 in GitLab 17.0.

    For more information about how to migrate to using Windows 2022, see [Windows 2022 support for GitLab.com runners now available](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/01/22/windows-2022-support-for-gitlab-saas-runners/).
