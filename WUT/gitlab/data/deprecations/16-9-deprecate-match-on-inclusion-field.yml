    In [Support additional filters for scan result policies](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6826#note_1341377224), we broke the `newly_detected` field into two options: `new_needs_triage` and `new_dismissed`. By including both options in the security policy YAML, you will achieve the same result as the original `newly_detected` field. However, you may now narrow your filter to ignore findings that have been dismissed by only using `new_needs_triage`.
    Based on discussion in [epic 10203](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10203#note_1545826313), we have changed the name of the `match_on_inclusion` field to `match_on_inclusion_license` for more clarity in the YAML definition.
