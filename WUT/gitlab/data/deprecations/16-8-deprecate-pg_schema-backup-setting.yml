  body: |
    You could configure GitLab to use a custom schema for backup, by setting
    `gitlab_rails['backup_pg_schema'] = '<schema_name>'` in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` for Linux package installations,
    or by editing `config/gitlab.yml` for self-compiled installations.

    While the configuration setting was available, it had no effect and did not serve the purpose it was intended.
    This configuration setting will be removed in GitLab 17.0.
