    In order to make the behavior of toggling the draft status of a merge request more clear via a quick action, we're deprecating and removing the toggle behavior of the `/draft` quick action. Beginning with the 16.0 release of GitLab, `/draft` will only set a merge request to Draft and a new `/ready` quick action will be used to remove the draft status.
