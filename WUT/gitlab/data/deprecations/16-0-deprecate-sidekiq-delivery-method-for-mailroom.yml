  body: |
    The `sidekiq` delivery method for `incoming_email` and `service_desk_email` is deprecated and is
    scheduled for removal in GitLab 19.0.

    GitLab uses a separate process called `mail_room` to ingest emails. Currently, GitLab administrators
    can configure their GitLab instances to use `sidekiq` or `webhook` delivery methods to deliver ingested
    emails from `mail_room` to GitLab.

    Using the deprecated `sidekiq` delivery method, `mail_room` writes the job data directly to the GitLab
    Redis queue. This means that there is a hard coupling between the delivery method and the Redis
    configuration. Another disadvantage is that framework optimizations such as job payload compression are missed.

    Using the `webhook` delivery method, `mail_room` pushes the ingested email body to the GitLab
    API. That way `mail_room` does not need to know your Redis configuration and the GitLab application
    adds the processing job. `mail_room` authenticates with a shared secret key.

    Reconfiguring an Omnibus installation generates this secret key file automatically,
    so no secret file configuration setting is needed.

    You can configure a custom secret key file (32 characters base 64 encoded) by running a command
    like below and referencing the secret file in `incoming_email_secret_file` and
    `service_desk_email_secret_file` (always specify the absolute path):

    ```shell
    echo $( ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.base64(32)" ) > ~/.gitlab-mailroom-secret
    ```

    If you run GitLab on more than one machine, you need to provide the secret key file for each machine.

    We encourage GitLab administrators to switch to the webhook delivery method for
    `incoming_email_delivery_method` and `service_desk_email_delivery_method` instead of `sidekiq`.

    [Issue 393157](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393157) tracks improving email ingestion in general.
    We hope this will simplify infrastructure setup and add several improvements to how you manage GitLab in the near future.
