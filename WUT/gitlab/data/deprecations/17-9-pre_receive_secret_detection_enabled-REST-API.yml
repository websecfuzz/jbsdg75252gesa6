   The REST API endpoint `pre_receive_secret_detection_enabled` is deprecated in favor of `secret_push_protection_enabled`. We are renaming some API fields to reflect the name change of the feature `pre_receive_secret_detection` to `secret_push_protection`.

   We have added the new API field name, but will no longer remove the old field name in GitLab 18.0 as originally announced.

   We will still update the database to [remove](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/512996) the old `pre_receive_secret_detection_enabled` database column, but you'll be able to use either API field name. Both will reflect the value of the new `secret_push_protection_enabled` database column.
