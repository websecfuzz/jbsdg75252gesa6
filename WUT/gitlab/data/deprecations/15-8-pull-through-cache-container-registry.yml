    The container registry [pull-through cache](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/mirror/) is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0. The pull-through cache is part of the upstream [Docker Distribution project](https://github.com/distribution/distribution). However, we are removing the pull-through cache in favor of the GitLab Dependency Proxy, which allows you to proxy and cache container images from Docker Hub. Removing the pull-through cache allows us also to remove the upstream client code without sacrificing functionality.
