    The container registry's Azure Storage Driver writes to `//` as the default root directory. This default root directory appears in some places within the Azure UI as `/<no-name>/`. We have maintained this legacy behavior to support older deployments using this storage driver. However, when moving to Azure from another storage driver, this behavior hides all your data until you configure the storage driver to build root paths without an extra leading slash by setting `trimlegacyrootprefix: true`.

    The new default configuration for the storage driver will set `trimlegacyrootprefix: true`, and `/` will be the default root directory. You can add `trimlegacyrootprefix: false` to your current configuration to avoid any disruptions.

    This breaking change will happen in GitLab 16.0.
