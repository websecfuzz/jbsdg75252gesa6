    In GitLab 15.3, [security report schemas below version 15 were deprecated](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#security-report-schemas-version-14xx).
    The `confidence` attribute on vulnerability findings exists only in schema versions before `15-0-0`, and therefore is effectively deprecated because GitLab 15.4 supports schema version `15-0-0`. To maintain consistency
    between the reports and our public APIs, the `confidence` attribute on any vulnerability-related components of our GraphQL API is now deprecated and will be
    removed in 17.0.
