    GitLab believes in secure-by-default practices. To honor this, we are making some changes to support least privilege principles relating to the use of CI/CD variables.
    Today, users with the Developer role or higher are able to use [pipeline variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/#use-pipeline-variables) by default, without any verification or opt-in.

    You can already start using a more secure-by-default experience for pipeline variables by raising the minimum role to the recommended [Owner only, or no one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/#restrict-pipeline-variables).
    Starting in 17.7, `no one allowed` is the default for all new projects in new namespaces on GitLab.com.
