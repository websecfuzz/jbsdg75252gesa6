    In GitLab 18.0, we are introducing a new data retention limit for GitLab.com Ultimate customers to improve system performance and reliability. The data retention limit affects how long your vulnerability data is stored for. Vulnerabilities older than 12 months that have not been updated are automatically moved to cold storage archives. These archives:

    - Remain accessible and downloadable through the GitLab UI.
    - Are retained for 3 years.
    - Are permanently deleted after 3 years.
