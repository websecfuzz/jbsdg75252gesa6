    The support for runner registration tokens is deprecated. Consequently, the support for resetting a registration token has also been deprecated
    and will be removed in a future GitLab release.

    A new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance has been implemented
    as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow/).
    For details, see [epic 7633](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7633).
    This new architecture introduces a new method for registering runners and eliminates the legacy
    [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/security/tokens/#runner-registration-tokens-deprecated).
    In a future GitLab release, only the runner registration methods implemented in the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be supported.
