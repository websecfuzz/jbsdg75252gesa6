    GitLab automatically creates anchor links for all headings, so you can link to
    a specific place in a Markdown document or wiki page. But in some edge cases,
    the autogenerated anchor is created with fewer dash (`-`) characters than many users expect.
    For example, with a heading with `## Step - 1`, most other Markdown tools and linters would expect `#step---1`.
    But GitLab generates an anchor of `#step-1`, with consecutive dashes compressed down to one.

    In GitLab 17.0, we will align our autogenerated anchors to the industry standard by no longer stripping consecutive dashes.
    If you have Markdown documents and link to headings that could have multiple dashes in 17.0,
    you should update the heading to avoid this edge case. With the example above, you
    can change `## Step - 1` to `## Step 1` to ensure in-page links continue to work.
