    To avoid confusion and duplication, the `environment_tier` parameter is deprecated in favor of the `environment_tiers` parameter. The new `environment_tiers` parameter allows DORA APIs to return aggregated data for multiple tiers at the same time. The `environment_tier` parameter will be removed in GitLab 16.0.
