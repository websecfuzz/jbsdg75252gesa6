    Long term support (LTS) for [OpenSSL version 1.1.1 ended in September 2023](https://endoflife.date/openssl). Therefore, OpenSSL 3 will be the default in GitLab 17.7. GitLab bundles OpenSSL 3, so you are not required to make any changes to your operating system.

    With the upgrade to OpenSSL 3:

    - GitLab requires TLS 1.2 or higher for all outgoing and incoming TLS connections.
    - TLS/SSL certificates must have at least 112 bits of security. RSA, DSA, and DH keys shorter than 2048 bits, and ECC keys shorter than 224 bits are prohibited.

    See the [GitLab 17.5 changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/versions/gitlab_17_changes/#1750) for more details.
