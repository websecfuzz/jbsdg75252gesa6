    The `migrationState` field in the `ContainerRepositoryType` of the GitLab GraphQL API will be removed in GitLab 18.0. This deprecation is part of our efforts to streamline and improve our API.

    To prepare for this change, we recommend reviewing and updating your GraphQL queries that interact with the `ContainerRepositoryType`. Remove any references to the `migrationState` field and adjust your application logic accordingly.
