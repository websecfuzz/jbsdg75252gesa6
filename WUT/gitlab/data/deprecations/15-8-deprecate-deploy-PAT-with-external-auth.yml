    With external authorization enabled, personal access tokens (PATs) and deploy tokens must no longer be able to access container or package registries. This defense-in-depth security measure will be deployed in 16.0. For users that use PATs and deploy tokens to access these registries, this measure breaks this use of these tokens. Disable external authorization to use tokens with container or package registries.
