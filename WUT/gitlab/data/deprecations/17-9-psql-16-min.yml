    GitLab follows an [annual upgrade cadence for PostgreSQL](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/data-access/database-framework/postgresql-upgrade-cadence/).

    Support for PostgreSQL 14 and 15 is scheduled for removal in GitLab 18.0.
    In GitLab 18.0, PostgreSQL 16 becomes the minimum required PostgreSQL version.

    PostgreSQL 14 and 15 will be supported for the full GitLab 17 release cycle.
    PostgreSQL 16 will also be supported for instances that want to upgrade prior to GitLab 18.0.

    If you are running a single PostgreSQL instance you installed by using an Omnibus Linux package, an automatic upgrade may be attempted with 17.11.
    Make sure you have enough disk space to accommodate the upgrade. For more information, see the [Omnibus database documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).
