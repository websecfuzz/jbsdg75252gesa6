    Due to historical reasons, small Linux GitLab.com Runners had a lot of tags attached because they were used as labels. We want to streamline the tag to just use `saas-linux-small-amd64` and be consistent across all GitLab.com runners.

    We are deprecating the tags: `docker`, `east-c`, `gce`, `git-annex`, `linux`, `mongo`, `mysql`, `postgres`, `ruby`, `shared`.

    For more information, see [Removing tags from our small SaaS runner on Linux](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/08/15/removing-tags-from-small-saas-runner-on-linux/).
