    Enabling the `ldap_settings_unlock_groups_by_owners` feature flag allowed non-LDAP synced users to be added to a locked LDAP group. This [feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1793) has always been disabled by default and behind a feature flag. We are removing this feature to keep continuity with our SAML integration, and because allowing non-synced group members defeats the "single source of truth" principle of using a directory service. Once this feature is removed, any LDAP group members that are not synced with LDAP will lose access to that group.
