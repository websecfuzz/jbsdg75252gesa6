    The Linux package provides custom queries for the bundled PostgreSQL exporter, which included a `per_table_stats` query controlled by `postgres_exporter['per_table_stats']`
    configuration setting.

    The PostgreSQL exporter now provides a `stat_user_tables` collector that provides the same metrics. If you had `postgres_exporter['per_table_stats']` enabled,
    enable `postgres_exporter['flags']['collector.stat_user_tables']` instead.
