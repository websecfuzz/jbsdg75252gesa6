    The Deployment API will now return an error when `updated_at` filtering and `updated_at` sorting are not used together. Some users were using filtering by `updated_at` to fetch "latest" deployment without using `updated_at` sorting, which may produce wrong results. You should instead use them together, or migrate to filtering by `finished_at` and sorting by `finished_at` which will give you "latest deployments" in a consistent way.
