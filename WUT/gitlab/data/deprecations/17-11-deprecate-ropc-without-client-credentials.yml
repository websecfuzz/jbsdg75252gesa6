    GitLab.com requires client authentication for OAuth Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) OAuth grant as of April 8, 2025. ROPC was omitted by the OAuth working group in RFC Version 2.1. Existing ROPC integrations without client credentials will experience service disruption after this date. If you experience disruption, update your integrations to include client credentials before the deadline. More information can be found [on our blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/01/improving-oauth-ropc-security-on-gitlab-com/).
