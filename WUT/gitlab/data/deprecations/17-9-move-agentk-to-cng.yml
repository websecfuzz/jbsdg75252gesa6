    We are moving the `agentk` container registry from
    [its project-specific registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/container_registry/1223205)
    to [the Cloud Native GitLab (CNG) registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/container_registry/8241772).
    From GitLab 18.0 onward, `agentk` images built in CNG will mirror into the project-specific registry.
    The new image is equivalent to the old image, except the new image only supports `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.
    It does not support the 32-bit `arm` architecture.
    From GitLab 19.0 onward, the project-specific registry will not receive `agentk` updates.
    If you mirror the `agentk` container to a local registry, you should change your mirror source to the
    [CNG registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/container_registry/8241772).

    If you use the official [GitLab Agent Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-agent/),
    the new `agentk` image will start deploying from the new location seamlessly in GitLab 18.0.
