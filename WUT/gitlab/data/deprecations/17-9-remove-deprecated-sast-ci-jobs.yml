    In GitLab 18.0, we will update the SAST CI/CD template to remove analyzer jobs that have reached End of Support in previous releases.
    The following jobs will be removed from `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` and `SAST.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`:

    - `bandit-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 15.4](#sast-analyzer-consolidation-and-cicd-template-changes)
    - `brakeman-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 17.0](#sast-analyzer-coverage-changing-in-gitlab-170)
    - `eslint-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 15.4](#sast-analyzer-consolidation-and-cicd-template-changes)
    - `flawfinder-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 17.0](#sast-analyzer-coverage-changing-in-gitlab-170)
    - `gosec-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 15.4](#sast-analyzer-consolidation-and-cicd-template-changes)
    - `mobsf-android-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 17.0](#sast-analyzer-coverage-changing-in-gitlab-170)
    - `mobsf-ios-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 17.0](#sast-analyzer-coverage-changing-in-gitlab-170)
    - `nodejs-scan-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 17.0](#sast-analyzer-coverage-changing-in-gitlab-170)
    - `phpcs-security-audit-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 17.0](#sast-analyzer-coverage-changing-in-gitlab-170)
    - `security-code-scan-sast`, which [reached End of Support in 16.0](#sast-analyzer-coverage-changing-in-gitlab-160)

    At the time when each analyzer reached End of Support, we updated its job `rules` to cause it not to run by default and stopped releasing updates.
    However, you might have customized the template to continue to use these jobs or depend on them existing in your pipelines.
    If you have any customization that depends on the jobs above, perform the [actions required](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/519133#actions-required) before
    upgrading to 18.0 to avoid disruptions to your CI/CD pipelines.
