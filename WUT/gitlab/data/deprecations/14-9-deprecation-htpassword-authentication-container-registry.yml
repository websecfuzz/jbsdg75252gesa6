    The container registry supports [authentication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#auth) with `htpasswd`. It relies on an [Apache `htpasswd` file](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html), with passwords hashed using `bcrypt`.

    Since it isn't used in the context of GitLab (the product), `htpasswd` authentication will be deprecated in GitLab 14.9 and removed in GitLab 15.0.
