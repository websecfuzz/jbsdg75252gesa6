  body: |
    Auto DevOps support for Herokuish is deprecated in favor of [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/autodevops/stages/#auto-build-using-cloud-native-buildpacks). You should [migrate your builds from Herokuish to Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/autodevops/stages/#moving-from-herokuish-to-cloud-native-buildpacks). From GitLab 14.0, Auto Build uses Cloud Native Buildpacks by default.

    Because Cloud Native Buildpacks do not support automatic testing, the Auto Test feature of Auto DevOps is also deprecated.
