    The `gitlab.kas.metrics.port` has been deprecated in favor of the new `gitlab.kas.observability.port` configuration field for the [GitLab Helm Chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2839).
    This port is used for much more than just metrics, which warranted this change to avoid confusion in configuration.
