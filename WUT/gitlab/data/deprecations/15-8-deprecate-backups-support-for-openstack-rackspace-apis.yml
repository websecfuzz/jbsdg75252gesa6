    We are deprecating support for **uploading backups to remote storage** using OpenStack Swift and Rackspace APIs. The support for these APIs depends on third-party libraries that are no longer actively maintained and have not been updated for Ruby 3. GitLab is switching over to Ruby 3 prior to EOL of Ruby 2 in order to stay up to date on security patches.

    - If you're using OpenStack, you need to change you configuration to use the S3 API instead of Swift.
    - If you're using Rackspace storage, you need to switch to a different provider or manually upload the backup file after the backup task is complete.
