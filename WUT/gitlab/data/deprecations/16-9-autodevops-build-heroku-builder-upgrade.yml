    In GitLab 17.0, the `auto-build-image` project will upgrade from the `heroku/builder:20` image to `heroku/builder:22`.

    To test the behavior of the new image, set the CI/CD variable `AUTO_DEVOPS_BUILD_IMAGE_CNB_BUILDER` to
    `heroku/builder:22`.

    To continue to use `heroku/builder:20` after GitLab 17.0,
    set `AUTO_DEVOPS_BUILD_IMAGE_CNB_BUILDER` to `heroku/builder:20`.
