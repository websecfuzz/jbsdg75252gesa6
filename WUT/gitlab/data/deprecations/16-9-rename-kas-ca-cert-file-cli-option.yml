    In the GitLab agent for Kubernetes (agentk), the `--ca-cert-file` command line option
    and the corresponding `config.caCert` Helm chart value have been renamed
    to `--kas-ca-cert-file` and `config.kasCaCert`, respectively.

    The old `--ca-cert-file` and `config.caCert` options are deprecated, and will
    be removed in GitLab 17.0.
