    From GitLab 16.9, Dependency Scanning and License Scanning support for Python 3.9 is deprecated. In GitLab 17.0, Python 3.10 is the default version for the Dependency Scanning CI/CD job.

    From GitLab 17.0, Dependency Scanning and License Scanning features won't support projects that require Python 3.9 without a
    [compatible lockfile](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#obtaining-dependency-information-by-parsing-lockfiles).
