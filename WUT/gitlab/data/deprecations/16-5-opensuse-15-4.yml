    Support and security updates for openSUSE Leap 15.4 is [ending November 2023](https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime#openSUSE_Leap).

    GitLab 15.4 provided packages for openSUSE Leap 15.5. GitLab 15.8 and later will not provide packages for openSUSE Leap 15.4.

    To prepare for GitLab 15.8 and later, you should:

    1. Move instances from openSUSE Leap 15.4 to openSUSE Leap 15.5.
    1. Switch from the openSUSE Leap 15.4 GitLab-provided packages to the openSUSE Leap 15.5 GitLab-provided packages.
