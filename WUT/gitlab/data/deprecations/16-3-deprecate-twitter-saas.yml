    Twitter OAuth 1.0a OmniAuth is being deprecated and removed on GitLab.com in GitLab 16.3 due to low use, lack of gem support, and the lack of a functional sign-in option for this feature. If you sign in to GitLab.com with Twitter, you can sign in with a password or another [supported OmniAuth provider](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in).
