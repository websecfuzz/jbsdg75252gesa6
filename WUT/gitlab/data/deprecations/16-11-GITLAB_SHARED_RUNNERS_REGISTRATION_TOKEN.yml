    The [`GITLAB_SHARED_RUNNERS_REGISTRATION_TOKEN`](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/environment_variables/#supported-environment-variables) environment variable is deprecated. GitLab introduced a new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/) in GitLab 15.8, which introduces a new method for registering runners and eliminates the legacy runner registration token. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow/) for guidance on migrating to the new workflow.
