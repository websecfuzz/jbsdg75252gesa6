    To change the approvals required for a merge request, you should no longer use the `/approvals` API endpoint, which was deprecated in GitLab 14.0.

    Instead, use the [`/approval_rules` endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/merge_request_approvals/#merge-request-level-mr-approvals) to [create](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/merge_request_approvals/#create-merge-request-level-rule) or [update](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/merge_request_approvals/#update-merge-request-level-rule) the approval rules for a merge request.
