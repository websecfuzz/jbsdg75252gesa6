  body: |
    The **License-Check feature** is now deprecated and is scheduled for removal in GitLab 16.0. Additionally, the Policies tab on the License Compliance page and all APIs related to the License-Check feature are deprecated and planned for removal in GitLab 16.0. Users who wish to continue to enforce approvals based on detected licenses are encouraged to create a new [License Approval policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/license_approval_policies/) instead.
