    We introduced the OpenTofu CI/CD template in 16.8 as CI/CD components were not available for GitLab Self-Managed yet.
    With the introduction of [GitLab CI/CD components for GitLab Self-Managed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/components/#use-a-gitlabcom-component-in-a-self-managed-instance)
    we are removing the redundant OpenTofu CI/CD templates in favor of the CI/CD components.

    For information about migrating from the CI/CD template to the component, see the [OpenTofu component documentation](https://gitlab.com/components/opentofu#usage-on-self-managed).
