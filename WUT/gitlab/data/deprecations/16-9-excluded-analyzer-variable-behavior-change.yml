    After delivering and verifying [Enforce SEP variables with the highest precedence](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/424028), we have discovered unintended behavior, allowing users to set `_EXCLUDED_PATHS` in pipeline configuration and preventing them from setting `_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` in both policy and pipeline configuration.

    To ensure proper enforcement of scan execution variables, when an `_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` or `_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variables are specified for a scan execution policy using the GitLab scan action, the variable will now override any project variables defined for excluded analyzers.

    Users may enable the feature flag to enforce this behavior before 17.0. In 17.0, projects leveraging the `_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS`/`_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variable where a scan execution policy with the variable is defined will be overridden by default.
