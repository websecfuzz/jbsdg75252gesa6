    The Static Site Editor will no longer be available starting in GitLab 15.0. Improvements to the Markdown editing experience across GitLab will deliver similiar benefit but with a wider reach. Incoming requests to the Static Site Editor will be redirected to the [Web IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/web_ide/).

    Current users of the Static Site Editor can view the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/web_ide/) for more information, including how to remove the configuration files from existing projects.
