    We'll remove support for the `kpt`-based installation of the agent for Kubernetes.
    Instead, you should install the agent with one of the supported installation methods:

    - Helm (recommended)
    - GitLab CLI
    - Flux

    To migrate from `kpt` to Helm, follow [the agent installation documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/agent/install/) to overwrite your `kpt`-deployed `agentk` instance.
