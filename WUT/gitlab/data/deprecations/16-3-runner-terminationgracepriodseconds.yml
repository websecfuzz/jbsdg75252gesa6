    The GitLab Runner Kubernetes executor setting, `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 17.0. To manage the cleanup and termination of GitLab Runner worker pods on Kubernetes, customers should instead configure `cleanupGracePeriodSeconds` and `podTerminationGracePeriodSeconds`. For information about how to use the `cleanupGracePeriodSeconds` and `podTerminationGracePeriodSeconds`, see the [GitLab Runner Executor documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes/#other-configtoml-settings).
