    The GitLab.com importer was deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0.

    The GitLab.com importer was introduced in 2015 for importing a project from GitLab.com to a GitLab Self-Managed instance through the UI.
    This feature is available on GitLab Self-Managed only. [Migrating GitLab groups and projects by direct transfer](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/#migrate-groups-by-direct-transfer-recommended)
    supersedes the GitLab.com importer and provides a more cohesive importing functionality.

    See [migrated group items](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/#migrated-group-items) and [migrated project items](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/#migrated-project-items) for an overview.
