    With GitLab 18.0 and GitLab chart 9.0, the Prometheus subchart will be updated from 15.3 to 27.3.
    Along with this update, Prometheus 3 will be shipped by default.

    Manual steps are required to perform the upgrade. If you have Alertmanager, Node Exporter or
    Pushgateway enabled, you will also need to update your Helm values.

    Please refer to the [migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/9_0/#prometheus-upgrade)
    for more information.
