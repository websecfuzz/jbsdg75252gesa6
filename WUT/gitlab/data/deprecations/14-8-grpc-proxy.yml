    Although not recommended or documented, it was possible to deploy a gRPC-aware proxy between Gitaly and
    the rest of GitLab. For example, NGINX and Envoy. The ability to deploy a gRPC-aware proxy is
    [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352517). If you currently use a gRPC-aware proxy for
    Gitaly connections, you should change your proxy configuration to use TCP or TLS proxying (OSI layer 4) instead.

    Gitaly Cluster became incompatible with gRPC-aware proxies in GitLab 13.12. Now all GitLab installations will be incompatible with
    gRPC-aware proxies, even without Gitaly Cluster.

    By sending some of our internal RPC traffic through a custom protocol (instead of gRPC) we
    increase throughput and reduce Go garbage collection latency. For more information, see
    the [relevant epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/463).
