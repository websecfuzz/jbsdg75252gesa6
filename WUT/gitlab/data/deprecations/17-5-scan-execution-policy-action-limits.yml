    New limits have been added for maximum scan execution policy actions allowed per policy. This change was introduced in 17.4 behind feature flags `scan_execution_policy_action_limit` and `scan_execution_policy_action_limit_group`. When enabled, only the first 10 actions of a scan execution policy are processed.

    By adding limits, we can ensure performance and scalability for security policies.

    If additional actions are needed, limit existing polices to no more than 10 actions. Then, create new scan execution policies with additional actions, within the limit of 5 scan execution policies per security policy project.

    For GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated administrators, you can configure a custom limit with the `scan_execution_policies_action_limit` application setting.
