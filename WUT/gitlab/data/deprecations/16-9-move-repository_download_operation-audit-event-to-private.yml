    The audit event type `repository_download_operation` is currently saved to the database for all project downloads, both public projects and private projects. For
    public projects, this audit event is not the most useful for auditing purposes because it can be triggered by non-authenticated users.

    From GitLab 17.0, the `repository_download_operation` audit event type will only be triggered for private or internal projects. We will add a new audit event type
    called `public_repository_download_operation` for public project downloads. This new audit event type will be streaming only.
