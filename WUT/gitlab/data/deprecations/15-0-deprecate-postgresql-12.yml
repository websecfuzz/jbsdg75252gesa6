    Support for PostgreSQL 12 is scheduled for removal in GitLab 16.0.
    In GitLab 16.0, PostgreSQL 13 becomes the minimum required PostgreSQL version.

    PostgreSQL 12 will be supported for the full GitLab 15 release cycle.
    PostgreSQL 13 will also be supported for instances that want to upgrade prior to GitLab 16.0.

    Support for PostgreSQL 13 was added to Geo in GitLab 15.2.
