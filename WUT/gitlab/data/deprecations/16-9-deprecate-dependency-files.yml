    Today in GitLab, a project's dependency list is generated using content from `dependency_files` in the Dependency Scanning report. However, to maintain consistency with the group dependency list, starting with GitLab 17.0, the project's dependency list will use CycloneDX SBOM report artifacts, stored in the PostgreSQL database. As such, the `dependency_files` property of the Dependency Scanning report schema is deprecated, and will be removed in 17.0.

    As a part of this deprecation, the [`dependency_path`](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_list/#dependency-paths) will also be deprecated and removed in 17.0. GitLab will move forward with the implementation of the [dependency graph using the CycloneDX specification](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/441118) to provide similar information.

    Additionally, the Container Scanning CI job [will no longer produce a Dependency Scanning report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/439782) to provide the list of Operating System components as this is replaced with the CycloneDX SBOM report. The `CS_DISABLE_DEPENDENCY_LIST` environment variable for Container Scanning is no longer in use and will also be removed in 17.0.
