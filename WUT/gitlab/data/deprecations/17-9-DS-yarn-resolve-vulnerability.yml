    The [Resolve a vulnerability](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#resolve-a-vulnerability) feature for Yarn projects
    provided by the Gemnasium analyzer for Dependency Scanning is deprecated in GitLab 17.9.

    While this functionality will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, it will not be available after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
    See details in [the migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/migration_guide_to_sbom_based_scans/)

    A replacement feature is planned as part of the [Auto Remediation vision](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7186) but no timeline has been set for its delivery.
