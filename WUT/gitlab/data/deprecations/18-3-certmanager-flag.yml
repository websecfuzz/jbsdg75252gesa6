    To enable schema validation of newer cert-manager charts, the GitLab Helm chart `certmanager.install` value is
    deprecated in favor of `installCertmanager`. The schema definition does not accept the extra property that we
    added within the `certmanager` section of the GitLab chart.

    In GitLab 18.3 (GitLab chart 9.3), we will remove the deprecated value and update the bundled cert-manager.

    If you've previously used the `certmanager.install` setting:

    1. Transfer the value of `certmanager.install` to `installCertmanager`.
    1. Remove the `certmanager.install` setting completely.
