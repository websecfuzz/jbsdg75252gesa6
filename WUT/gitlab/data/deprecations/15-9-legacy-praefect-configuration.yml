  body: |
    Previously, Praefect configuration keys were scattered throughout the configuration file. Now, these are in a single configuration structure that matches
    Praefect configuration so the previous configuration method is deprecated.

    The single configuration structure available from GitLab 15.9, though backwards compatibility is maintained. Once removed, Praefect must be configured using the single
    configuration structure. You should update your Praefect configuration as soon as possible using
    [the upgrade instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/#praefect-omnibus-gitlab-configuration-structure-change).

    This change brings Praefect configuration in Omnibus GitLab in line with the configuration structure of Praefect. Previously, the hierarchies and configuration keys
    didn't match. The change improves consistency between Omnibus GitLab and source installs and enables us to provide better documentation and tooling for both.
