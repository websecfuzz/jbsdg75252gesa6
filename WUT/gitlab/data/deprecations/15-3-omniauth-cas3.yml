    The `omniauth-cas3` gem that provides GitLab with the CAS OmniAuth provider will be removed in our next major
    release, GitLab 16.0. This gem sees very little use and its lack of upstream maintenance is preventing GitLab from
    [upgrading to OmniAuth 2.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30073).
