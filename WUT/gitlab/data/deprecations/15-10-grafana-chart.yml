    The Grafana Helm chart that is bundled with the GitLab Helm Chart is deprecated and will be removed in the GitLab Helm Chart 7.0 release (releasing along with GitLab 16.0).

    The bundled Grafana Helm chart is an optional service that can be turned on to provide the Grafana UI connected to the GitLab Helm Chart's Prometheus metrics.

    The version of Grafana that the GitLab Helm Chart is currently providing is no longer a supported Grafana version.
    If you're using the bundled Grafana, you should switch to the [newer chart version from Grafana Labs](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/grafana/grafana)
    or a Grafana Operator from a trusted provider.

    In your new Grafana instance, you can [configure the GitLab provided Prometheus as a data source](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration/#configure-grafana)
    and [connect Grafana to the GitLab UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration/#integrate-with-gitlab-ui).
