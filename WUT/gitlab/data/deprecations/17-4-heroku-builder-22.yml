    The cloud native buildpack (CNB) builder image was updated to `heroku/builder:24` in the Auto DevOps Build project. While we don't expect the changes to be disruptive for the most part, this might be a breaking change for some users of Auto DevOps, and especially users of Auto Build. To better understand the impact of you workloads, review the following:

    These changes affect you if your pipelines use the [`auto-build-image`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-build-image) provided by [the Auto Build stage of Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/autodevops/stages/#auto-build).
