- title: "Support for Praefect custom metrics endpoint configuration"
  announcement_milestone: "15.9"
  removal_milestone: "16.0"
  breaking_change: true
  reporter: mjwood
  stage: Gitaly
  issue_url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390266
  body: |
    Support for using the `prometheus_exclude_database_from_default_metrics` configuration value is deprecated in GitLab
    15.9 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0. We are removing this configuration value because using it is non-performant.
    This change means the following metrics will become unavailable on `/metrics`:

    - `gitaly_praefect_unavailable_repositories`.
    - `gitaly_praefect_verification_queue_depth`.
    - `gitaly_praefect_replication_queue_depth`.

    This may require updating your metrics collection targets to also scrape `/db_metrics`.
