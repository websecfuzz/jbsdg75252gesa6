    We are removing a non-standard extension to our GraphQL processor, which we added for backwards compatibility. This extension modifies the validation of GraphQL queries, allowing the use of the `ID` type for arguments where it would normally be rejected.
    Some arguments originally had the type `ID`. These were changed to specific
    kinds of `ID`. This change may be a breaking change if you:

    - Use GraphQL.
    - Use the `ID` type for any argument in your query signatures.

    Some field arguments still have the `ID` type. These are typically for
    IID values, or namespace paths. An example is `Query.project(fullPath: ID!)`.

    For a list of affected and unaffected field arguments,
    see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352832).

    You can test if this change affects you by validating
    your queries locally, using schema data fetched from a GitLab server.
    You can do this by using the GraphQL explorer tool for the relevant GitLab
    instance. For example: `https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer`.

    For example, the following query illustrates the breaking change:

    ```graphql
    # a query using the deprecated type of Query.issue(id:)
    # WARNING: This will not work after GitLab 15.0
    query($id: ID!) {
      deprecated: issue(id: $id) {
        title, description
      }
    }
    ```

    The query above will not work after GitLab 15.0 is released, because the type
    of `Query.issue(id:)` is actually `IssueID!`.

    Instead, you should use one of the following two forms:

    ```graphql
    # This will continue to work
    query($id: IssueID!) {
      a: issue(id: $id) {
        title, description
      }
      b: issue(id: "gid://gitlab/Issue/12345") {
        title, description
      }
    }
    ```

    This query works now, and will continue to work after GitLab 15.0.
    You should convert any queries in the first form (using `ID` as a named type in the signature)
    to one of the other two forms (using the correct appropriate type in the signature, or using
    an inline argument expression).
