    If GitLab starts without any Redis configuration file present,
    GitLab assumes it can connect to three Redis servers at `localhost:6380`,
    `localhost:6381` and `localhost:6382`. We are changing this behavior
    so GitLab assumes there is one Redis server at `localhost:6379`.

    Administrators who want to keep the three servers must configure
    the Redis URLs by editing the `config/redis.cache.yml`,`config/redis.queues.yml`
    and `config/redis.shared_state.yml` files.
