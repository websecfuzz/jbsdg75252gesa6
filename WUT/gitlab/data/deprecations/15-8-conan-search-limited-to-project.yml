    You can use the GitLab Conan repository with [project-level](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/conan_repository/#add-a-remote-for-your-project) or [instance-level](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/conan_repository/#add-a-remote-for-your-instance) endpoints. Each level supports the Conan search command. However, the search endpoint for the project level is also returning packages from outside the target project.

    This unintended functionality is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0. The search endpoint for the project level will only return packages from the target project.
