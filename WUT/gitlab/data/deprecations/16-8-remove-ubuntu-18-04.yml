    Standard support for Ubuntu 18.04 [ended on June 2023](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).

    From GitLab 17.0, we will not provide Linux packages for Ubuntu 18.04.

    To prepare for GitLab 17.0 and later:

    1. Move servers running GitLab instances from Ubuntu 18.04 to either Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04.
    1. Upgrade your GitLab instances using Linux package for the version of Ubuntu you're now using.
