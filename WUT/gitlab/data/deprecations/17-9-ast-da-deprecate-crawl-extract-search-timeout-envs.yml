   The DAST variables `DAST_CRAWL_EXTRACT_ELEMENT_TIMEOUT` and `DAST_CRAWL_SEARCH_ELEMENT_TIMEOUT` are deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 18.0.
   When they were introduced, the variables provided granular timeout controls for specific browser interactions. These interactions are now governed by a common timeout value, which makes the variables unnecessary. In addition, because of an underlying implementation issue, the variables haven't been functional since the introduction of the DAST browser-based analyzer.
   Removing these two variables will simplify DAST configuration, and provide a better onboarding experience for users.
