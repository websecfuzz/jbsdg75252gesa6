    The [`project_fingerprint`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2791) attribute of vulnerability findings is being deprecated in favor of a `uuid` attribute. By using UUIDv5 values to identify findings, we can easily associate any related entity with a finding. The `project_fingerprint` attribute is no longer being used to track findings, and will be removed in GitLab 17.0. Starting in 16.1, the output of `project_fingerprint` returns the same value as the `uuid` field.
