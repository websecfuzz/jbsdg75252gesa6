    The `setPreReceiveSecretDetection` GraphQL mutation has been renamed to `setSecretPushProtection`. We are also renaming some fields in the mutation's response to reflect the name change of the feature `pre_receive_secret_detection` to `secret_push_protection`.

    We have added the new mutation name, but will no longer remove the old mutation name in GitLab 18.0 as originally announced.

    We will still update the database to [remove](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/512996) the old `pre_receive_secret_detection_enabled` database column, but you'll be able to use either mutation name. Both will reflect the value of the new `secret_push_protection_enabled` database column.
