    The GitLab Runner GraphQL API endpoints will not return `paused` or `active` as a status in GitLab 16.0.
    In a future v5 of the REST API, the endpoints for GitLab Runner will also not return `paused` or `active`.

    A runner's status will only relate to runner contact status, such as:
    `online`, `offline`, or `not_connected`. Status `paused` or `active` will no longer appear.

    When checking if a runner is `paused`, API users are advised to check the boolean attribute
    `paused` to be `true` instead. When checking if a runner is `active`, check if `paused` is `false`.
