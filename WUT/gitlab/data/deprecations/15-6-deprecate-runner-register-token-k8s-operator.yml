    The [`runner-registration-token`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/operator/#install-the-kubernetes-operator) parameter that uses the OpenShift and Kubernetes Vanilla Operator to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated. Authentication tokens will be used to register runners instead. Registration tokens, and support for certain configuration arguments,
    will be removed in a future GitLab release. For more information, see [Migrating to the new runner registration workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow/).
    The configuration arguments disabled for authentication tokens are:

    - `--locked`
    - `--access-level`
    - `--run-untagged`
    - `--tag-list`

    This change is a breaking change. You must use an [authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/runners_scope/) in the `gitlab-runner register` command instead.

    See also how to [prevent your runner registration workflow from breaking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow/#prevent-your-runner-registration-workflow-from-breaking) in GitLab 17.0 and later.
