    The `omnibus_gitconfig['system']` configuration item has been deprecated. If you use
    `omnibus_gitconfig['system']` to set custom Git configuration for Gitaly, you must configure Git
    directly through Gitaly configuration under `gitaly[:configuration][:git][:config]` before upgrading to GitLab 17.0.

    For example:

    ```ruby
      gitaly[:configuration][:git][:config] = [
        {
          key: 'fetch.fsckObjects',
          value: 'true',
        },
        # ...
      ]
    ```

    The format of the configuration keys must match what is passed to `git` through the CLI flag `git -c <configuration>`.

    If you have trouble converting the existing keys to the expected format, see the existing keys in the correct format in
    the Linux package-generated configuration file of Gitaly. By default, the configuration file is located at
    `/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/config.toml`.

    The following configuration options that are managed by Gitaly should be removed. These keys do not need to be migrated
    to Gitaly:

    - `pack.threads=1`
    - `receive.advertisePushOptions=true`
    - `receive.fsckObjects=true`
    - `repack.writeBitmaps=true`
    - `transfer.hideRefs=^refs/tmp/`
    - `transfer.hideRefs=^refs/keep-around/`
    - `transfer.hideRefs=^refs/remotes/`
    - `core.alternateRefsCommand="exit 0 #"`
    - `core.fsyncObjectFiles=true`
    - `fetch.writeCommitGraph=true`
