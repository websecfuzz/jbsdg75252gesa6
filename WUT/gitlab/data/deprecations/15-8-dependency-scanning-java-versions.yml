    GitLab has deprecated Dependency Scanning support for Java versions 13, 14, 15, and 16 and plans to remove that support in the upcoming GitLab 16.0 release. This is consistent with [Oracle support policy](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html) as Oracle Premier and Extended Support for these versions has ended. This also allows GitLab to focus Dependency Scanning Java support on LTS versions moving forward.
