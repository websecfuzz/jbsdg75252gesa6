    For those using Dependency Scanning for Python projects, we are deprecating the default `gemnasium-python:2` image which uses Python 3.6 as well as the custom `gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9` image which uses Python 3.9. The new default image as of GitLab 15.0 will be for Python 3.9 as it is a [supported version](https://endoflife.date/python) and 3.6 [is no longer supported](https://endoflife.date/python).

    For users using Python 3.9 or 3.9-compatible projects, you should not need to take action and dependency scanning should begin to work in GitLab 15.0. If you wish to test the new container now please run a test pipeline in your project with this container (which will be removed in 15.0). Use the Python 3.9 image:

    ```yaml
    gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:
      image:
        name: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9
    ```

    For users using Python 3.6, as of GitLab 15.0 you will no longer be able to use the default template for dependency scanning. You will need to switch to use the deprecated `gemnasium-python:2` analyzer image. If you are impacted by this please comment in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351503) so we can extend the removal if needed.

    For users using the 3.9 special exception image, you must instead use the default value and no longer override your container. To verify if you are using the 3.9 special exception image, check your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for the following reference:

    ```yaml
    gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:
      image:
        name: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9
    ```
