    The syntax of [GitLabs database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/)
    configuration located in `database.yml` is changing and the legacy format is deprecated. The legacy format
    supported using a single PostgreSQL adapter, whereas the new format is changing to support multiple databases. The `main:` database needs to be defined as a first configuration item.

    This deprecation mainly impacts users compiling GitLab from source because Omnibus will handle this configuration automatically.
