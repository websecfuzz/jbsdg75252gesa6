    [ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/) with OIDC support
    were introduced in GitLab 15.7. These tokens are more configurable than the old JSON web tokens (JWTs), are OIDC compliant,
    and only available in CI/CD jobs that explicitly have ID tokens configured.
    ID tokens are more secure than the old `CI_JOB_JWT*` JSON web tokens which are exposed in every job,
    and as a result these old JSON web tokens are deprecated:

    - `CI_JOB_JWT`
    - `CI_JOB_JWT_V1`
    - `CI_JOB_JWT_V2`

    To prepare for this change, configure your pipelines to use [ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#id_tokens)
    instead of the deprecated tokens. For OIDC compliance, the `iss` claim now uses
    the fully qualified domain name, for example `https://example.com`, previously
    introduced with the `CI_JOB_JWT_V2` token.

    In GitLab 15.9 to 15.11, you can [enable the **Limit JSON Web Token (JWT) access**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/#enable-automatic-id-token-authentication)
    setting, which prevents the old tokens from being exposed to any jobs and enables
    [ID token authentication for the `secrets:vault` keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication).

    In GitLab 16.0 and later:

    - This setting will be removed.
    - CI/CD jobs that use the `id_tokens` keyword can use ID tokens with `secrets:vault`,
      and will not have any `CI_JOB_JWT*` tokens available.
    - Jobs that do not use the `id_tokens` keyword will continue to have the `CI_JOB_JWT*`
      tokens available until GitLab 17.0.

    In GitLab 17.0, the deprecated tokens will be completely removed and will no longer
    be available in CI/CD jobs.
