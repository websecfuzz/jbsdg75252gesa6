    In GitLab 17.11, we created a duplicate audit event type with the name `user_profile_visibility_updated` to replace the audit event type
    `user_profile_visiblity_updated` that is misspelled. You should begin to migrate to this new audit event type as soon as possible.

    In GitLab 18.6, we'll remove the `user_profile_visiblity_updated` event type.
