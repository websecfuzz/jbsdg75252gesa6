    The runner's legacy escape sequence mechanism to handle variable expansion implements a sub-optimal implementation of Ansi-C quoting. This method means that the runner would expand arguments included in double quotes. As of 15.11, we are deprecating the legacy escaping and quoting methods in the runner shell executor.
