    The ability to add Grafana panels in GitLab Flavored Markdown is deprecated in 15.9 and will be removed in 16.0.
    We intend to replace this feature with the ability to [embed charts](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/opstrace/-/epics/33) with the [GitLab Observability UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace/opstrace-ui).
