    For clarity, the GraphQL field `registrySizeEstimated` was renamed to `containerRegistrySizeIsEstimated`, to match its counterpart.
    `registrySizeEstimated` was deprecated in GitLab 16.2 and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.
    Use `containerRegistrySizeIsEstimated` introduced in GitLab 16.2 instead.
