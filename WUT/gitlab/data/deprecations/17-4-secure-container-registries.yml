    Container registries under `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/`
    are no longer accessible in GitLab 18.0. [Since GitLab 14.8](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#secure-and-protect-analyzer-images-published-in-new-location)
    the correct location is under `registry.gitlab.com/security-products` (note the absence of
    `gitlab-org` in the address).

    This change improves the security of the release process for GitLab [vulnerability scanners](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/#vulnerability-scanner-maintenance).

    Users are advised to use the equivalent registry under `registry.gitlab.com/security-products/`,
    which is the canonical location for GitLab security scanner images. The relevant GitLab CI
    templates already use this location, so no changes should be necessary for users that use the
    unmodified templates.

    Offline deployments should review the [specific scanner instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/offline_deployments/#specific-scanner-instructions)
    to ensure the correct locations are being used to mirror the required scanner images.
