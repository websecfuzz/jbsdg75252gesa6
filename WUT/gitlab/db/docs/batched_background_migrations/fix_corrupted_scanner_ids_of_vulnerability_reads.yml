migration_job_name: FixCorruptedScannerIdsOfVulnerabilityReads
description: >-
  There was a bug in production where the scanner_id of a
  vulnerability finding would be updated, yet the scanner_id of the
  related vulnerability_read would remain unchanged. This is an issue
  as the vulnerability_read should always be in sync with the
  vulnerability finding.

  The bug has been fixed in production. This
  migration finds any vulnerability_reads with a scanner_id mismatch
  with the vulnerability_occurrence. It updates the vulnerability_read
  to have the value from the vulnerability_occurrence
