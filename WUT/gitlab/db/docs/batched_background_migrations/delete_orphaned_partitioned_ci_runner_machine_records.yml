migration_job_name: DeleteOrphanedPartitionedCiRunnerMachineRecords
description: >-
  Removes ci_runner_machines_687967fa8a records that don't have a matching ci_runners_e59bb2812d record.
  This can happen because there was a period in time where a FK didn't exist.
  Deleted in 17.11 since this can collide with 20250307080000_replace_ci_runners_machines_with_partitioned_table
