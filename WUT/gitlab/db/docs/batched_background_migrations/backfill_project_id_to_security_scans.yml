migration_job_name: BackfillProjectIdToSecurityScans
description: Backfills `ci_builds.project_id` to be used as the sharding key. The association
  with `ci_builds` initially did not have a foreign key, so we need to check for rows that do
  not have a corresponding `ci_builds` record and delete them.
