migration_job_name: ResyncBasicEpicFieldsToWorkItem
description: We backfilled all epics to the issues table to create an epic work item in 17.0.
  This unblocked all migrations that depended on having a work item for every epic. At this time
  the epic to work item sync was not enabled so epic work items got out of sync after updates.
  By 17.1 we enabled syncing epics to work items by default and with this migration we re-sync
  all epic work items to be in a synced state by 17.2.
