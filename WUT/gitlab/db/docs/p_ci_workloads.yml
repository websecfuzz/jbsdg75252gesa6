description: Stores a small amount of metadata related to a workload object. This
  is primarily to keep track of the pipeline which the workload ran in. Longer term
  it acts as an abstraction around the pipeline so that we can replace the backing
  pipeline with another runtime without consumers (e.g. Duo Workflow) needing to change
  any logic.
