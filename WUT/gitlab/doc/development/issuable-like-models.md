title: Issuable-like Rails models utilities
---

GitLab Rails codebase contains several models that hold common functionality and behave similarly to
[Issues](../user/project/issues/_index.md). Other examples of "issuables"
are [merge requests](../user/project/merge_requests/_index.md) and
[Epics](../user/group/epics/_index.md).

This guide accumulates guidelines on working with such Rails models.

## Important text fields

There are maximum length constraints for the most important text fields for issuables:

- `title`: 255 characters
- `description`: 1 megabyte
