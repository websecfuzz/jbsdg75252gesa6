{{< /details >}}

Every API call to [project](../user/project/_index.md) statistics must be authenticated.
Retrieving these statistics requires read access to the repository.

For use with a [personal access token](../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md),
use a token with `read_api` scope. For a [group access token](../user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.md),
you can use Reporter role and `read_api` scope.

This API retrieves the number of times the project is either cloned or pulled
with the HTTP method. SSH fetches are not included.
