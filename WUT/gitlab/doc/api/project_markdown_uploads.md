Uploads a file to the specified project to be used in an issue or merge request description, or a comment.

```plaintext
POST /projects/:id/uploads
```

Supported attributes:

| Attribute | Type              | Required | Description |
|:----------|:------------------|:---------|:------------|
| `file`    | string            | Yes      | File to be uploaded. |
| `id`      | integer or string | Yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths). |

To upload a file from your file system, use the `--form` argument. This causes cURL to post data using the
`Content-Type: multipart/form-data` header. The `file=` parameter must point to a file on your file system and be
preceded by `@`.

Example request:

```shell
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
     --form "file=@dk.png" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/5/uploads"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "alt": "dk",
  "url": "/uploads/66dbcd21ec5d24ed6ea225176098d52b/dk.png",
  "full_path": "/-/project/1234/uploads/66dbcd21ec5d24ed6ea225176098d52b/dk.png",
  "markdown": "![dk](/uploads/66dbcd21ec5d24ed6ea225176098d52b/dk.png)"
}
```

In the response, the:

- `full_path` is the absolute path to the file.
- `url` can be used in Markdown contexts. The link is expanded when the format in `markdown` is used.
