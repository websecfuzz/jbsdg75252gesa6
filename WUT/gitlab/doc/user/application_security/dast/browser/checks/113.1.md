title: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers
---

## Description

By inserting Carriage Return / Line Feed (CRLF) characters, malicious users could potentially inject arbitrary data into HTTP responses. By modifying HTTP responses, attackers could conduct cross-site scripting or cache poisoning attacks against other users of the system.

## Remediation

User input should never be used in constructing HTTP header responses without some form
of validation against newlines. This includes URLs supplied by the user for HTTP redirects.
