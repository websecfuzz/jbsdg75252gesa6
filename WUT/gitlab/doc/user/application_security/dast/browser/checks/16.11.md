title: TRACE HTTP method enabled
---

## Description

The debug TRACE method was found to be enabled on the target web server. This
HTTP method reflects HTTP request data back to the user in a response. In some circumstances
this information may include sensitive data that is applied by intermediary proxies.

## Remediation

The TRACE HTTP method is for debugging only and should not be enabled on production
sites.

For Apache based web servers, ensure the `TraceEnable` directive is either removed or set to
`off`.

For Microsoft Servers, remove the registry parameter named "EnableTraceMethod" found in the below
registry key:

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters`

For all other server types, consult your product's documentation on how to disable the TRACE method.
