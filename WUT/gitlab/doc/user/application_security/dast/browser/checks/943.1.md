title: Improper neutralization of special elements in data query logic
---

## Description

The application generates a query intended to interact with MongoDB,
but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements
that can modify the intended logic of the query.

## Remediation

Refactor find or search queries to use standard
filtering operators such as `$gt` or `$in` instead of broad operators such
as `$where`. If possible, disable the MongoDB JavaScript interface entirely.
