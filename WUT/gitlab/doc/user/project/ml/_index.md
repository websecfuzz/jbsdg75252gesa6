GitLab Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is set of tools designed to help with
your machine learning workflows.

GitLab MLOps features include:

- Model registry: Manage your machine learning models, along with associated metadata such
as parameters, performance metrics, artifacts, and logs. For more information, see
[model registry](model_registry/_index.md).
- Model experiments: Track and manage machine learning experiments in GitLab.
An experiment is a collection of comparable model candidates, which are variations of the training of a
machine learning model. For more information, see [model experiments](experiment_tracking/_index.md).

## GitLab MLOps Python client

GitLab offers a Python client to interact with the GitLab MLOps features.
