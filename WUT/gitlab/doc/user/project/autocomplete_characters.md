The autocomplete characters provide a quick way of entering field values into
Markdown fields. When you start typing a word in a Markdown field with one of
the following characters, GitLab progressively autocompletes against a set of
matching values. The string matching is not case-sensitive.

| Character | Autocompletes | Relevant matches shown |
| :-------- | :------------ | :---- |
| `~`       | Labels | 20 |
| `%`       | Milestones | 5 |
| `@`       | Users and groups | 10 |
| `#`       | Issues | 5 |
| `!`       | Merge requests | 5 |
| `&`       | Epics | 5 |
| `$`       | Snippets | 5 |
| `:`       | Emoji | 5 |
| `/`       | Quick Actions | 100 |

When you select an item from the list, the value is entered in the field.
The more characters you enter, the more precise the matches are.

You can use autocomplete characters in combination with [Quick Actions](quick_actions.md).

## User autocomplete

Assume your GitLab instance includes the following users:

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = NO -->

| Username        | Name |
| :-------------- | :--- |
| alessandra      | Rosy Grant |
| lawrence.white  | Kelsey Kerluke |
| leanna          | Rosemarie Rogahn |
| logan_gutkowski | Lee Wuckert |
| shelba          | Josefine Haley |

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = YES -->

User autocompletion sorts by the users whose username or name start with your query first.
For example, typing `@lea` shows `leanna` first and typing `@ros` shows `Rosemarie Rogahn` and `Rosy Grant` first.
Any usernames or names that include your query are shown afterwards in the autocomplete menu.

You can also search across the full name to find a user.
To find `Rosy Grant`, even if their username is for example `alessandra`, you can type their full name without spaces like `@rosygrant`.
