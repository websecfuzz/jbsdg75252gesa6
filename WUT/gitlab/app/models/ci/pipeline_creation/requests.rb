# frozen_string_literal: true

# This class represents the metadata for the pipeline creation process up until it succeeds and is persisted or fails
# It has the "in progress" status until it succeeds or fails.
# It stores the data in Redis and it is retained for 5 minutes.
# The structure of the data is:
# {
#   "REDIS_KEY": {
#     "CREATION_ID": {
#       "error" => "ERROR MESSAGE" <- this field is only present for failed creations
#       "pipeline_id": "PIPELINE_ID" <- this field is only present for successful creations
#       "status": "STATUS"
#     }
#   }
# }
# NOTE: For general project pipelines, `REDIS_KEY` includes the project ID and the request ID for the pipeline creation.
# This means that the request ID is referenced twice when fetching the request data - in `REDIS_KEY` and in
# `CREATION_ID`. It also means that the value for `REDIS_KEY` will only ever contain one pipeline creation request.
# This is somewhat unexpected, but it is necessary in order to match the data structure for merge request pipelines
# (which can have several pipelines creation requests stored under their `REDIS_KEY`). We've decided that maintaining
# two separate data structures is more confusing and results in more code, so it's better to match the data structures
# even if it means that we have a redundant use of the request ID when storing general project pipeline creation
# requests.
#
# NOTE: The `REDIS_KEY` for general project pipelines MUST contain the request ID (not only the project ID) in order to
# ensure that the keys expire. Some projects are so active that their creation request data will never expire from
# Redis if we store all the pipeline creations for a project under one key.
#
# NOTE: All hash keys should be strings because this data is JSONified for Redis and the pipeline creation workers.
#
# TODO: In an attempt to make the Redis data easier to understand, we plan to simplify the way we store MR pipeline
# creation data in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/509925
