# Contract testing for GitLab

This directory contains the contract test suites for GitLab, which use the [Pact](https://pact.io/) framework.

The consumer tests are written using [`jest-pact`](https://github.com/pact-foundation/jest-pact) and the provider tests are written using [`pact-ruby`](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby).
