# This list tracks unknown abilities per policy.
#
# This file is used by `spec/support/ability_check.rb`.
#
# Each TODO entry means that an ability wasn't found in
# the particular policy class or its delegations.
#
# This could be one of the reasons:
# * The ability is misspelled.
#     - Suggested action: Fix typo.
# * The ability has been removed from a policy but is still in use.
#     - Remove production code in question.
# * The ability is defined in EE policy but is used in FOSS code.
#     - Guard the check or move it to EE folder.
#     - See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ee_features.html
# * The ability is defined in another policy but delegation is missing.
#     - Add delegation policy or guard the check with a type check.
#     - See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/policies.html#delegation
# * The ability check is polymorphic (for example, Issuable) and some policies
#   do not implement this ability.
#     - Exclude TODO permanently below.
#     - Guard the check with a type check.
# * The ability check is defined on GraphQL field which does not support
#   authorization on resolved field values yet.
